        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The manuscript of
        this Commentary was completed several years ago, but its publication
        was unfortunately deferred until the author's health no longer
        permitted him to see it through the press or even to be consulted in
        regard to modifications. For this latter reason no change of any kind
        has been made either in the language or the arrangement of the
        material. In the bibliography we have added the two recent monumental
        contributions to the literature on the Book of Revelation,
        commentaries by I. T. Beckwith and R. H. Charles. Had the author
        possessed the physical strength after their appearance, we feel sure
        that he would have drawn upon these two extensive works which are
        intended for the use of technical scholars.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The significance
        of Dr. Hunter's <span class="tei tei-q">“Studies in the Book of
        Revelation”</span> lies in its clear and accurate presentation of the
        results of the investigation of modern scholars, in language which is
        comprehensible to the intelligent reader of the English Bible. The
        Revelation of St. John has been an enigma from the earliest Christian
        centuries. On the one hand, it has been shunned because of its
        mysteriousness; on the other, it has been discredited for
        sober-minded, intelligent Christians by the absurd vagaries of its
        interpreters. Too often the caprice or predilection of the
        commentator, rather than impartial study, has determined the meaning
        of the closing book of the New Testament canon. The removal of this
        reproach has been one of the signal achievements of the Biblical
        scholarship of the last twenty-five years. Such a notable result has
        been accomplished by the discovery and the interpretation of the
        Jewish Apocalyptic, a type of literature that flourished from 200 B.
        C. on for several centuries. The Revelation belongs to this type of
        literature. It is the expression of a Christian's faith in the
        triumph of his Lord's kingdom through the use of symbolism and
        imagery peculiar to Jewish Apocalyptic literature. Our author, in
        common with all modern scholars, has used this key for unlocking the
        mystery of the closing book of the Christian Scriptures. By its
        employment he has made clear the meaning of the Revelation to the
        open-minded reader of the English Bible. On every page the work gives
        evidence of scholarship, wide in <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page010">[pg 010]</span><a name="Pg010" id="Pg010" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> its range, and thorough in its grasp, as well
        as of sanity of judgment in the discussion of controversial
        questions. Because of these qualities, Dr. Hunter's treatise is
        worthy of wide circulation. It meets a special need at this time as
        it is especially adapted to counteract fantastic theories of
        interpretation and theology which are based on a misunderstanding of
        both the purpose and the symbolism of a New Testament book that ranks
        as an equal of the greatest pieces of imaginative literature.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The proofs have
        been read by Mr. Walter H. Millinger, of the senior class of the
        Seminary, and the publication of the book has been made possible only
        by the painstaking effort of a devoted friend and fellow-worker of
        Dr. Hunter, Mr. W. H. Wicks of the Pittsburgh Printing Company to
        whom both the author and the reader are deeply indebted.</p>

        main aim of which, as is clear from every page, is to emphasize the
        overwhelming worth of things spiritual as contrasted with things

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The purpose of
        this volume is to present in concise form the general thought and
        meaning of the Book of Revelation, to give an analytic view of its
        contents, and to summarize the results of critical study. It is
        intended both as an aid to interpretation, and as a guide to the use
        of the many valuable commentaries which are now accessible to the
        English reader. It is specially designed to meet the needs of the
        student in the theological seminary or the modern Bible school, the
        busy pastor in his field, the teacher of adult Bible classes, the
        Christian Association worker, and the general reader of the Bible.
        With this object in view it essays to provide in a direct and helpful
        form (1) the essential points of Introduction; (2) an Analytic Study
        of the book which aims to discover its meaning as a whole rather than
        to deal with it text by text; and (3) a brief statement in a series
        of Appendices of some of the underlying conceptions which give color
        to its thought and enter into its literary structure.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The increased
        impetus given to Biblical study by advanced scholarship in late years
        has created a demand for a class of works that give the results
        attained by the masters of exegesis and critical research, without
        attempting to give the various steps by which these results have been
        reached. And it is one primary aim of this work, while attempting to
        give a fresh statement of the teachings of the book, and to present
        such thoughts as have come to the Author in the course of extended
        study, at the same time to give due consideration to the varying
        opinions of others, and for the most part to reproduce in the form
        which these have taken in his own mind the best and most satisfactory
        explanations of the many difficulties in the book which have hitherto
        been given by leading scholars and commentators. For the book has
        proved a fertile field for expositors that has been widely even if
        not always well worked in the past, while in the last half-century
        really substantial progress has been made toward the general
        interpretation; and it may be confidently assumed that any one who
        ignores these results has almost certainly nothing to contribute to
        the solution of the real difficulties that confront us. In response
        to extended popular inquiry some excellent commentaries and
        expository works on the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page015">[pg
        015]</span><a name="Pg015" id="Pg015" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        Revelation have been prepared in late years for the general reader.
        And it is in order to further meet this requirement of intelligent
        Bible study, and to contribute in some measure to what is believed to
        be one of the most common needs of the general student of Scripture,
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a
        comprehensive view of each book</span></span>, that the publication
        of the present Studies in the Book of Revelation has been
        undertaken.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is necessarily
        true that a work so largely poetical in its thought as the
        Apocalypse, and appealing so much to the imagination, does not lend
        itself easily to logical analysis. Every such division, if
        exhaustive, must be in a measure arbitrary. The main purpose in
        attempting it is to present the principal ideas of the book in what
        is conceived to be their proper relation. And in this we need not
        assume that the particular outline which we adopt was formally in the
        mind of the writer. It is quite enough if we can be assured that the
        formative ideas were conceived of in somewhat the same relation, and
        that the analysis we accept at least measurably represents the
        author's point of view. This form of statement enables us to grasp
        the contents of the book in their entirety and to retain them in
        memory.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The view presented
        in the Analysis and Notes of this volume is not intended to be
        controversial but interpretative. Hence other views of particular
        passages have often not been stated, or are given only in foot-notes,
        and no special effort has been made to support the view given by any
        extended discussions, as that would lead us too far afield for the
        purpose in mind. For those who wish a wider view, references are
        given to well-known authorities. Much that might have been said has
        been left out for the sake of brevity; for in this busy age few find
        time for extended study, and the great works on the Revelation often
        lie unread on the shelves. To reach the man of this generation the
        message must be short, clear, and decisive. And with this in view the
        chief aim is to show that the general meaning of the Revelation can
        be clearly understood, whatever difference of opinion there may be
        concerning the more difficult portions; and as a contribution toward
        this end to give in a direct form what the Author of the present work
        regards as the correct method of interpreting it. Other
        interpretations have been introduced where they serve to illustrate
        this main purpose, or have special force and afford additional light,
        or have been widely accepted and have affected the course of opinion.
        The outline interpretation <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page016">[pg
        016]</span><a name="Pg016" id="Pg016" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        given in this work, while it does not follow without deviation any
        particular view throughout or in every respect—for a blind acceptance
        of any one method of interpretation would often block the path to
        better knowledge, and perhaps cause us to miss the real meaning—yet
        it accepts the principles of the Symbolical or Spiritual School as
        affording in the main the best solution of the problems of
        interpretation. The authorities cited in connection with any passage,
        when not quoted, though they may differ somewhat in statement, will
        be found to hold in some form the view given in the analysis.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is not without
        considerable hesitation, and a personal sense of the shortcomings of
        the present work, that it is now given to the public. It necessarily
        contains much that is already familiar to the reader, and it should
        be regarded as an effort to present in concise form and in one's own
        way what has been gathered through many years of patient study, and
        by constant comparison with the works of the best commentators,
        together with such thoughts as have come to the Author in the course
        of his inquiry. And if thereby the reader should be in any measure
        led to a clearer understanding or a more careful study of this
        marvellously beautiful and strangely eloquent message of Christ to
        his church which is contained in the Book of Revelation—the meaning
        of which has been too often misunderstood by the Christian reader, or
        passed by as an insoluble mystery,—it will be to the Author an
        abundant reward for his effort and a cause for personal gratitude to
        Almighty God.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Revelation
          is the most difficult book to interpret of any in the New Testament
          canon. Its meaning is often involved in much obscurity, and the
          interpretation of eminent scholars has differed so widely in the
          past that we cannot always be sure, especially in the more
          difficult portions, that the particular view which appears to us
          the more satisfactory or convincing is certainly the correct one.
          This divergence of opinion has had the unfortunate effect of
          disparaging the worth of the Apocalypse as a part of the Word of
          God in the mind of many earnest students, who have come to regard
          its meaning as so obscure, and hidden in such hopeless perplexity,
          that any further attempt to interpret it is entirely fruitless. So
          much, too, has been written about the book which abounds in
          manifest vagaries that men of sober mind have often been thereby
          deterred from forming or expressing any definite opinion concerning
          its teaching. Indeed it is difficult to say whether the Revelation
          has suffered more in the hands of expositors by means of fanciful
          and mistaken interpretation of its true contents, or by the
          interpolation of ideas wholly foreign to its thought. But, however
          brought about, we have reached this strangely incongruous result,
          that what was originally designed to be the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">revelation</span></em> of mystery has become
          instead the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">mystery</span></em> of Revelation.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is evident
          necessity, therefore, of particular care in forming our views with
          regard to the meaning of many portions of the book, and also of
          often holding our opinions tentatively and subject to review,
          especially in our earlier studies, as probable rather than positive
          interpretations. We should avoid alike the mistake of dogmatically
          asserting that the Apocalypse cannot be understood at all, or of
          affirming that it can be fully understood.<a id="noteref_2" name=
          "noteref_2" href="#note_2"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2</span></span></a> And yet
          with this reservation in mind the book is still a rich mine of
          spiritual wealth, much of which lies upon the surface, while even
          its deeper mysteries abundantly reward our careful search. For we
          are not justified <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page018">[pg
          018]</span><a name="Pg018" id="Pg018" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          in casting aside any part of divine revelation upon the plea of
          apparent obscurity; and to do so is practically to deny that it is
          a revelation. On the contrary we are under manifest obligation to
          interpret the message of the Apocalypse so far as we can, for to
          fail of this is to neglect the sure word of prophecy. And even
          though the original meaning of the visions to John's mind, and the
          interpretation given them by those to whom they were first made
          known, oftentimes cannot now be definitely determined,<a id=
          "noteref_3" name="noteref_3" href="#note_3"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3</span></span></a> yet the
          value of the book does not depend solely upon that, however helpful
          it would be. The matter of supreme importance for us is to
          apprehend aright the far-seeing and ulterior purpose in the mind of
          the Spirit in giving the Revelation. And in search for this we
          should not allow our zeal for the original interpretation to lead
          us to forget the significant lesson of the Old Testament, that the
          primary teaching of prophecy has often not voiced its deeper
          message, that God's thought has mostly proved wider than man's
          first apprehension; so that in our reading of the prophets we are
          not limited to the primary application, however important it may
          be, but should strive rather to grasp the broader sweep and deeper
          thought made plain by the fuller development of the divine
          purpose—the general meaning for the whole church in all time rather
          than the particular meaning for one age or generation. This
          consideration we will find of great value in dealing with the
          generic and flexile forms of imagery contained in the symbols of
          the Apocalypse, where in attending to a multiplicity of detail the
          deeper and broader thought may so easily be misapprehended or even
          entirely escape our notice.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The visions of
          the Apocalypse are generally conceded to belong to the latter part
          of the first century, and manifestly relate in main portion to the
          then future, whether near or far, of the church of Christ in the
          world, for they pertain to a profoundly impressive prophetic
          experience. The divine path of God's people among the nations is
          beheld in symbol, type, and figure, ever leading on to victory
          through Jesus Christ his Son and our Lord; the church and the world
          are seen engaged in a multiform <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page019">[pg 019]</span><a name="Pg019" id="Pg019" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> and deadly conflict, while the consummation
          is depicted in the fall of evil and the ruin of nature wrought by
          sin; and the triumph of the holy is set forth in a vision of
          complete restoration to the divine presence amid the beauty of a
          new world and the glories of the New Jerusalem—an outcome never
          once in doubt, for God rules through all and wins. And though in
          this ever changing picture the conditions of the early church and
          of the first century are constantly reflected in every part, yet
          the representative character of the whole may be clearly seen.
          Indeed one cannot but be impressed with the fine insight and spirit
          of reserve which is manifested by John throughout the book, in
          avoiding such explanations as might serve to narrow the visions to
          a purely local and temporary perspective, thereby evidencing that
          he had risen to a truly prophetic view, and that to his mind the
          visions belonged to a wider horizon as well as to the nearer limit
          of his own day. For whatever application or fulfilment these may
          have had, and surely <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">did</span></em> have, in the period in which
          they were given, has not exhausted their meaning. To the ear that
          is open to God's voice they have a lesson and significance that
          belong alike to the past, the present, and the future, a perennial
          freshness that time can neither fade nor destroy, for they manifest
          the principles of the divine government which abide for all the
          ages.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the light of
          modern criticism the primary question to be decided is whether we
          are dealing with an ordinary Jewish-Christian apocalypse of similar
          value with a multitude of others in the past, and with no
          essentially deeper meaning or diviner message; or whether we have
          not in the Apocalypse of John a true revelation, given in this
          literary form because of its particular suitability to the
          condition of the time, and its fitness for the needs of the
          generation that first received it. And the answer to this question
          must be sought in the contents of the book itself as vindicated by
          the Christian conscience—an answer that the church has never been
          slow to make, and that never can be changed so long as the needs of
          the human heart remain the same. We must therefore regard the
          fundamental question which lies back of that of interpretation,
          viz. the inspiration of the book itself, which alone can give it
          permanent value to the Christian mind, as definitely settled by the
          clear message which it contains for life, by the multitudinous
          voices <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page020">[pg
          020]</span><a name="Pg020" id="Pg020" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          of God which reverberate within it, and by the heaven-born solace
          which it ever affords to tried and tempted men in the midst of the
          conflict of life. And we shall find that the general meaning, so
          far from being hopelessly obscure, may be fairly understood by the
          attentive student and devout reader.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The obscurity of
          the Revelation arises both from its literary form and from the
          mystical character of its contents. The Apocalyptic form is so
          foreign to our way of thinking, and the mysticism is so peculiarly
          Oriental and Jewish, that these are apt to perplex rather than
          enlighten us. The Apocalyptist, deeply absorbed in the later
          prophecies of the Old Testament, especially those of Daniel and
          Ezekiel, and his mind steeped in the dreams and images of current
          Jewish apocalypses, found under the influence of the Spirit a
          fitting sphere for his prophetic fervor in a series of strange
          symbolic visions such as belonged to the fashion of his time. The
          chief symbolism throughout is that of the Old Testament, quickened
          and vivified by the thought of the New,—for it is everywhere
          assumed that the mysteries of the former dispensation find their
          only adequate solution in the supreme and final testimony of Jesus
          the Christ,<a id="noteref_4" name="noteref_4" href=
          "#note_4"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">4</span></span></a>—but the
          atmosphere of the visions is that of Apocalyptic, which curiously
          enough has contrived to cast its own peculiar glow upon all the Old
          Testament teachings and thus create a new symbolism out of the old.
          And even when many of the symbols are assumed to be drawn in their
          present form from apocalypses then current in the Jewish world but
          which are no longer extant, and these to be derived in part from
          Babylonian and Persian sources, as held by one class of
          interpreters, they are yet found to have become so assimilated by
          the Jewish mind that they reflect the later development of Old
          Testament thought. These visions of the seer, like shadows cast
          upon the foreground of the future, depict in outline great
          fundamental truths or pervasive principles of the divine government
          that are, and are to be, manifested in multiple facts in the
          progress of the ages. It is not the purpose of the visions to
          disclose the facts themselves, for that belongs to the development
          of history, but rather to furnish the means for interpreting the
          facts, when once they appear, by the exalted standard of the divine
          ideals. There are, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page021">[pg
          021]</span><a name="Pg021" id="Pg021" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          indeed, a few cardinal facts of the future that are kept well in
          the foreground, such as the second coming of Christ, the triumph of
          God's kingdom, and the end of the present world; but these belong
          to the content of previous revelation as well, and are not new or
          peculiar to this book. The content of the visions is generic and
          not specific, and whenever we depart from broad generalization and
          attempt to enter into detail in our interpretation, we destroy the
          beauty and force of the lesson conveyed, and wander into the field
          of speculation concerning things that were never intended to be
          revealed, if the analogy of all other prophecy can be relied upon

          though the Apocalypse undoubtedly contains an element of predictive
          prophecy, yet such prophecy is not history written before its time,
          but a divinely inspired and profoundly discriminative pre-view of
          certain dominant issues in the future that belong to the purpose of
          God, and are the resultant of well established principles of the
          divine government—issues that stand out to the prophet's illumined
          eye in bold relief against the sky-line like the headlands of a
          continent amid the surrounding mists which envelop them.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Prophecy in this
          view is looked upon as much broader in its scope than the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">fore</span></em>telling of things that are
          future. This element should be regarded as subordinate to the
          general purpose of prophecy, which is the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">forth</span></em>telling of the mind of
          God.<a id="noteref_6" name="noteref_6" href="#note_6"><span class=

          should avoid that <span class="tei tei-q">“dwarfed sense of the
          word prophecy in modern speech”</span> which leads most readers
          (and even interpreters) to fasten upon a revelation of the secrets
          of the future. For it is evident that <span class="tei tei-q">“Old
          Testament history and prophecy make prominent another kind of
          revelation—the unveiling of the ideal, as when the pattern of
          things sacred was unfolded to Moses in the mount”</span>.<a id=

          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">7</span></span></a> In the
          true sense of prophecy it manifestly contains both these
          conceptions, viz. the Prophetico-predictive, and the
          Prophetico-ideal, which enter in varying proportion into the great
          messages of old. But it is believed by many of our best
          authorities, and it will be found in a careful study of the
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page022">[pg 022]</span><a name=
          "Pg022" id="Pg022" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> book of Revelation,
          that the prophetic element is not chiefly predictive in the strict
          sense, and can for the most part be best interpreted as the
          unveiling of the divine ideal which is being inwrought in the
          sphere of human life, or the manifestation of the divine purpose
          which is discovered as interpenetrating all the moral struggle and
          apparent contradictions of earthly experience, and which is leading
          up to the final victory; and only such glimpses of the future are
          given as serve to assure a better comprehension of this main
          idea.<a id="noteref_8" name="noteref_8" href="#note_8"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The two most
          obvious principles that pervade the book of Revelation and underlie
          its ever changing scenes, are, <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">first</span></em>,
          God's method of government in the world by the trial of his people
          and the judgment of the wicked; and, <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">second</span></em>,
          God's method of developing character in moral agents by moral
          conflict. Accepting these as in a measure interpretative of the
          ways of God with men, the Apocalypse approaches the standpoint of
          the divine perspective, and traces the great lines of the divine
          purpose as they traverse the entire field of human history. It
          makes Christ's relation to his people both in time and in eternity
          the ground of an exhaustive inquiry into the mysteries of earthly
          life, which aims not only to discover God in the trend of history
          but also to interpret God through history wrought out to its end.
          It affords glimpses of God's far reaching plan in the process of
          redemption, leading up to the final salvation of unnumbered
          multitudes; it finds the key to earth's long-drawn-out story of sin
          and suffering, of conflict and of death, in wider victory at larger
          cost; and it teaches us to look calmly out beyond the ebb and flow
          of tides and noons to the shoreless, timeless life that ever abides
          in the presence of God. To the heart of faith it speaks of an
          unwavering trust when days are dark and storms fill the sky; like a
          clear voice out of the night it tells of the coming day; and with
          persuasive force its visions bring man face to face with God, his
          Creator, Redeemer, and Eternal Friend.</p>

          "tei tei-q">“the Divine”</span>. Our American Revisers read,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“The Revelation of John;”</span> but the
          more correct title is the one that is commonly used, and that is
          printed in the upper margin of the text, simply <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The Revelation,”</span> i. e. the unveiling, or
          uncovering [viz. of the mystery of the divine purpose and method in
          human life and history]—the opening words of the book itself—or, if
          preferred, the original Greek name, <span class="tei tei-q">“The

          perhaps should have been retained without translation as in the
          Douay Version, but of which <span class="tei tei-q">“The
          Revelation”</span> is the exact equivalent. The phrase <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“of St. John”</span>, or <span class="tei tei-q">“of
          John”</span>, may properly be omitted because of its ambiguity; for
          the book is declared in its opening sentence to be <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the Revelation of Jesus Christ”</span>, i. e. a
          revelation of or from Jesus Christ, and it is only in a secondary
          sense <span class="tei tei-q">“the Revelation of John”</span>, i.
          e. a revelation made to and recorded by John. The occasion for the
          use of this title, <span class="tei tei-q">“The Revelation of St.
          John”</span>, in the first centuries was in order to distinguish
          the canonical Apocalypse from many others then in circulation, but
          this necessity has long since ceased to exist. For us it stands
          alone, it is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That the Author
          of the Revelation was named John we have no reason to doubt, if we
          believe the statements of the book itself, for this is distinctly
          affirmed three different times.<a id="noteref_10" name="noteref_10"

          God, or the theologian. This latter designation, though of
          uncertain origin and date, and omitted by the American Revisers as
          without sufficient support, is yet undoubtedly as old as the latter
          part of the third century<a id="noteref_11" name="noteref_11" href=
          "#note_11"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">11</span></span></a> while
          it may be much older, and has therefore some <span class=

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> claim to traditional authority. The
          title, however, in any form is subsequent to the book itself. The
          statements of the Author concerning himself and his relations to
          the church in Asia, appear to the general reader to be decisive,
          and to indicate with sufficient clearness that the writer was none
          other than John the son of Zebedee, the apostle whom Jesus loved,
          though this is not the view of the majority of the later critics.
          Some consider it to be the work of another John known to tradition
          as the Presbyter;<a id="noteref_12" name="noteref_12" href=
          "#note_12"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">12</span></span></a> others
          attribute it to an unknown author of that name, or to some one
          writing under that name. But notwithstanding the frequency and
          positiveness with which the Apostolic Authorship and the Unity of
          the Book have been called in question during the last half century,
          the entire results of critical research may with some confidence be
          said not to have discredited either of them.<a id="noteref_13"
          name="noteref_13" href="#note_13"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">13</span></span></a></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
          considerations which support the Apostolic Authorship are chiefly
          the following:—(1) the evidence of early Christian tradition
          imbedded in history is practically unanimous in its favor, and the
          book was accepted as the Apostle's without question by the church
          in Asia where it originated: (2) the internal evidence is to most
          minds convincing and even decisive, viz. (a) the Author declares
          himself to be John, and addresses the churches in Asia as their
          <span class="tei tei-q">“brother, and partaker in
          tribulation,”</span> and there is no satisfactory historical
          evidence of any other John in Asia, except the Apostle, of
          sufficient standing and influence to have spoken to the churches
          with the authority of a prophet;<a id="noteref_14" name=
          "noteref_14" href="#note_14"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">14</span></span></a> (b)
          there is a deep and essential similarity of thought, diction, and
          doctrine in the Apocalypse and in John's Gospel and Epistles which
          outweighs all differences of language, grammar, and style that
          appear upon the surface; (c) there is an undercurrent <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page025">[pg 025]</span><a name="Pg025" id="Pg025"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“tragic
          tone”</span> found in the Apocalypse, such as is manifest in all of
          John's writings, especially when he deals with the sad and terrible
          phases of human life and character, and this serves to point toward
          the Apostle as the author.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The grounds upon
          which the Apostolic Authorship is denied are:—(1) the general
          inconclusiveness of tradition, even though in this case the
          evidence is admitted to be particularly strong: (2) the
          pseudonymity of all other apocalypses, with the apparent exception
          of <span class="tei tei-q">“The Shepherd of Hermas”</span>, and
          hence the probability that this in a similar way may have been
          written under the assumed name of John in order to give it
          acceptance:<a id="noteref_15" name="noteref_15" href=
          "#note_15"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">15</span></span></a> (3)
          the marked differences observable between the Apocalypse and John's
          Gospel and Epistles, viz. (a) the Greek of the Apocalypse is full
          of striking peculiarities, of solecisms, and of Hebraisms, quite at
          variance with the purer style of the other Johannine
          writings;<a id="noteref_16" name="noteref_16" href=
          "#note_16"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">16</span></span></a> (b)
          the spirit of the Apocalypse as revealed in its ideas, terms, tone,
          and temper, differs widely from that of the Gospel and Epistles.
          These differences, however, it should be noted, were recognized and
          their force as objections to a common authorship was felt as early
          as the time of Dionysius (circ. A. D. 260), for they are apparent
          to every careful student of the Greek text; but they may be
          accounted for in a good degree by the difference of occasion,
          purpose, and theme, as well as of form and structure incident to
          the choice of a literary style that has definite and necessary
          limitations. The differences have also been further accounted for
          on the part of some by accepting the earlier date of the
          Apocalypse, which in that case is assigned to the period just
          preceding the fall of Jerusalem. The peculiarities of language are
          in this view attributable to an imperfect knowledge of Greek, which
          was later overcome by John's long residence in Ephesus, while the
          apocalyptic form and general contents are held to indicate an
          earlier stage of Christian thought.<a id="noteref_17" name=
          "noteref_17" href="#note_17"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          other hand <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page026">[pg
          026]</span><a name="Pg026" id="Pg026" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          it has been efficiently maintained, favoring the later date, that
          the differences are mainly due to psychological effects wrought by
          old age in the mind of John, whose mental activities reverted to
          the familiar thought-forms and apocalyptic conceptions of his
          youth, the Greek he used being simply a modified translation of
          Hebrew thought, while the Christological conceptions of the
          Apocalypse are manifestly among the most advanced in the New
          Testament.<a id="noteref_18" name="noteref_18" href=
          "#note_18"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">18</span></span></a> In any
          case it will be seen that the reasons given under (1) and (2) have
          little force apart from the question of internal evidence, and are
          at most only inferences, while upon the other hand the divergent
          qualities given under (3), forceful as they are, cannot be assumed
          as without parallel in the history of literature. It has been
          pointed out that the difference in style between Carlyle's earlier
          and later productions, as well as those found in the works of
          Milton, Watts, Burke, and Wordsworth, written at different periods
          in their lives, is quite as marked as that of the writings in
          question.<a id="noteref_19" name="noteref_19" href=
          "#note_19"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">19</span></span></a> And we
          must not leave out of view the possibility that John, if at an
          advanced age, may have used one of his disciples as a collaborator,
          which would necessarily modify both the language and style of the
          work produced. So that after all has been said, it may be accepted
          as the concurrent judgment of the majority of interpreters,—the
          advanced critics being excepted,—that as great or greater
          difficulties are met in denying the Apostolic Authorship as in
          accepting it. For notwithstanding the confident assertion of most
          of the later critics that the Apocalypse was not written by the
          Apostle, yet indications are not lacking in some quarters now,
          influenced perhaps by the really cogent arguments so well stated by
          the decadent school of Baur, of a return in opinion to the
          recognition of the Johannine authorship as in some sense at least
          undeniable, though foreign elements are conceived to enter into
          it.<a id="noteref_20" name="noteref_20" href=
          "#note_20"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">20</span></span></a> It has
          indeed, not infrequently been held, among those who deny that the
          Apostle was the author of the Fourth Gospel, that he wrote the
          Apocalypse; but still more commonly it is accepted that the work
          belongs to the <span class="tei tei-q">“so-called Johannine
          writings”</span>, and originated in the same circle at Ephesus to
          which these <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page027">[pg
          027]</span><a name="Pg027" id="Pg027" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          writings are now attributed by advanced critics,<a id="noteref_21"

          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">21</span></span></a>
          leaving the personal authorship more or less indefinite. The
          question of authorship, however, is a subordinate one, for the book
          maintains its own message, and it should be dealt with purely as a
          subject of historical inquiry and not one of dogmatic importance,
          in the interest of correctness rather than of traditional
          opinion.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The question of
          Unity is one of modern literary criticism. The view now generally
          accepted that Jewish apocalypses, as we find them, are often of
          composite origin, representing an original writing to which various
          additions have been subsequently made by editors and
          redactors,<a id="noteref_22" name="noteref_22" href=
          "#note_22"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">22</span></span></a> has
          had its influence upon the judgment formed by critics concerning
          the Apocalypse of John. The present tendency of critical
          investigation is to consider the book as a composite structure, and
          to direct its effort toward searching out the various sources from
          which it is supposed to be derived, and determining what parts of
          the book are original, as well as in pointing out various minor
          passages that are regarded as drawn from other sources, or are the
          work of a later hand. This tendency has been carried to such an
          extreme that the results are largely theoretical and inconclusive,
          depending upon the personal taste of the critic and having little
          force for other minds. The grounds upon which the unity of the book
          has been disputed are:—(1) Frequent breaks in continuity which make
          it difficult or impossible to trace the connection of thought: (2)
          a lack of harmony in its various conceptions that is more or less
          incongruous, and that is apparently inconsistent with its being the
          work of one author: (3) an apparent indication in various parts of
          the book of different dates of writing—see remarks in the section
          on Date. All of these reasons, however, if taken together, and it
          be granted that they are well-founded, are yet insufficient to
          establish a diversity of authorship. The most that can be said is
          that they suggest it. For it should be remembered that logical
          sequence is not a quality of Apocalyptic thought; and also that
          there is not even an approximate agreement, as yet, among advanced
          scholars as to the character or extent of the material regarded as
          drawn from other sources.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In favor of its
          Unity we find:—(1) a uniformity of style throughout which is
          scarcely possible in the combined product of different authors
          without such redaction as is equivalent to authorship: (2) an
          elaborate literary structure quite incompatible with the existence
          of more than one author—see section on Structure: (3) an essential
          Unity, whatever the extent to which elements of Jewish apocalyptic
          may have been made use of in its composition, which appeals to the
          literary judgment in a way that is both forcible and convincing,
          for the personality of the author is interwoven in every fibre of
          its frame. Though the present trend of critical opinion is largely
          against the Unity of the book in the general sense of the term, yet
          its essential unity is so manifest that it is commonly
          conceded—<span class="tei tei-q">“its inner unity is the foundation
          of all more recent works on the Apocalypse”</span>.<a id=
          "noteref_23" name="noteref_23" href="#note_23"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">23</span></span></a> This
          is accounted for on the part of those who accept a composite origin
          by attributing its unification to the final editor, redactor, or
          author, a judgment that fails to carry conviction with it for those
          who approach the question from the broader standpoint of literary
          composition in general, instead of the narrower one of the
          apocalyptic writings. The later critical views have, however, not
          yet reached a conclusive stage, and indeed in the face of so great
          diversity of judgment, can scarcely be said to have assumed a
          consistent form; though it may be confidently predicated that no
          hypothesis of composite origin is ever likely to command general
          assent in the case of a book marked by such a definite unity of
          style and plan. The effort to discover in it an original Jewish
          apocalypse which has been wrought over by Christian editors into
          its present form,<a id="noteref_24" name="noteref_24" href=
          "#note_24"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">24</span></span></a> or to
          reconstruct the various sources, Jewish or Christian, from which it
          has been derived,<a id="noteref_25" name="noteref_25" href=
          "#note_25"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          well be said to have been <span class="tei tei-q">“thoroughly
          worked out”</span>, and to have apparently failed, though the
          labors of the critics have added largely to our knowledge of
          Apocalyptic, and contributed not a little to a better understanding
          of the book. The view now in the ascendant admits one author, but
          attributes various portions of greater or less extent to a common
          stock of Jewish, or Jewish-Christian, apocalyptic fragments,
          current <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page029">[pg
          029]</span><a name="Pg029" id="Pg029" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          composition.<a id="noteref_26" name="noteref_26" href=

          to the more conservative Christian mind, involves an apparent
          denial of its true unity, and proceeds upon a theory of its origin
          that is scarcely consistent with its effective inspiration. But it
          fails to be conclusive on other grounds, for upon careful
          examination it must become more and more apparent to the thoughtful
          student of Scripture and apocalyptic that this view does not accord
          with the author's use of his materials, so far as we have any
          knowledge of their source. For although he draws largely from the
          thought and figures of the prophets, and uses freely the general
          form of imagery found in extant Jewish apocalypses, yet everything
          has been transmuted in the crucible of his own vivid imagination
          into new combinations, and there is not a single instance in which
          he interpolates an entire passage from any known author—indeed
          there are no quotations at all, in the strict sense, found in the
          Apocalypse, but only allusions, reminiscences, and echoes, literary
          devices which reflect the thought without reproducing the form—and
          it is certainly an exceptional assumption that he interpolates only
          from authors whose works are now lost, or from sources furnished
          solely by tradition.<a id="noteref_27" name="noteref_27" href=
          "#note_27"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          impressions of unity are entirely too strong to be dissipated by
          visionary and purely theoretical views.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A modified form

          indicates a healthful reaction from the piecemeal theories of the
          earlier source-criticism, and affords valuable suggestion for
          further study—whether, indeed, we can follow them or not in finding
          evidence of the introduction of a limited number of fragments of
          earlier origin,—viz. that the author drew freely from a mass of
          apocalyptic ideas and forms, or <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“apocalyptic conventions”</span> as they have been
          called, which were widely current in Jewish circles, and with which
          his own mind was richly stored; and that this suggestive material
          was wrought over in his mental processes and used like that from
          the Old Testament, with which it was closely allied, as a framework
          for expressing the new and higher Christian thought peculiar to his
          message, the old form <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page030">[pg
          030]</span><a name="Pg030" id="Pg030" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          being constantly adapted to new meanings. The origin or source of
          these forms is chiefly a matter of theory; but the probability of
          their use is the more practical side of the problem. It will be
          seen that this view would account for all that the theory of
          diverse origin does without doing violence to the real unity of the
          book;<a id="noteref_29" name="noteref_29" href=
          "#note_29"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          does not affect the question of the inspiration or reality of the
          visions, for the thought of the seer necessarily took form from his
          own mental furnishing, and his imagination, though quickened by the
          prophetic ecstasy, was not essentially altered in its mode of
          operation. But, with it all, let us not fail to apprehend that
          these questions pertaining to the method used in the composition of
          the Apocalypse, and to the introduction of foreign elements into
          its literary structure, which so largely occupy the minds of
          critical scholars in the present day, are, after all, mainly
          secondary to the larger question. In it has God spoken? And if so,
          what are the spiritual lessons of the book for the devout Christian
          mind and heart?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Two different
          Dates of authorship have been commonly maintained by different
          authorities, viz. either about A. D. 69 under one of Nero's
          immediate successors, Galba or Vespasian; or about A. D. 96 under
          Domitian. Many modern critics have accepted the earlier date,
          though the majority of commentators favor the later and traditional
          one. The evidence cannot be considered as decisive for either, but
          the preponderance seems to be in favor of the later date.<a id=
          "noteref_30" name="noteref_30" href="#note_30"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">30</span></span></a> The
          earlier date, though accepted by the majority of critics a score
          and more years ago, is not now in such favor. The influence of
          present criticism, which is chiefly taken up with discussion of the
          sources from which the book is assumed to be derived, has produced
          a marked drift in opinion toward the acceptance of a date near the
          close of the first century (the traditional view) as the time of
          composition, or at least the period of final editing.<a id=
          "noteref_31" name="noteref_31" href="#note_31"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">31</span></span></a> This
          view, though accepting in a sense one author, yet holds that the
          contents of the book indicate different dates of writing, and that
          it is made up of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page031">[pg
          031]</span><a name="Pg031" id="Pg031" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          visions of different origin, and composed at different times, which
          have been subsequently formed into one consistent whole<a id=

          conclusion that would require something more than a theory to
          sustain it. The exact date, however, is not of any great
          importance, as the difference does not materially affect the
          interpretation, especially if we accept the symbolic view of the
          purpose and teaching of the book; for though the date fixed upon
          does affect somewhat the historical situation, and hence the
          immediate reference, it does not affect the larger meaning which
          belongs to all time.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The indications
          of the Earlier Date that usually obtain are:—(1) the linguistic
          peculiarities already referred to under the head of Unity, which
          are considered by many to indicate an earlier period in John's life
          and thought when he was still Hebraistic in method: (2) the
          historical allusions in the book that seem to favor the earlier
          date, and which some have thought are even decisive, viz. (a) the
          condition of the churches in Asia as set forth in the Seven
          Epistles, which fairly accords with what is known of the period of
          Nero's reign and shortly thereafter; (b) the references to
          persecution, war, earthquake, famine, and pestilence, which find a
          ready explanation in current events of the earlier date;<a id=
          "noteref_33" name="noteref_33" href="#note_33"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">33</span></span></a> (c)
          the measurement of the temple directed in ch. 11:1f., which appears
          to indicate that it was still standing; (d) the apparently veiled
          allusions to Nero found in the description of the Wild Beast in
          chs. 13 and 17, which, according to a widely accepted
          interpretation, point to a period shortly after his death, when he
          was still a prominent figure in the public mind.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For the Later
          Date the chief considerations are:—(1) the early and uniform
          tradition concerning the origin of the book, viz. that it was
          written by the Apostle John near the end of the reign of Domitian
          (see the section on Canonicity): (2) the historical situation
          described and implied, which as a whole is considered by most
          authorities as more suitable to and more fully met by the later
          than the earlier date, viz. (a) the churches in Asia, as indicated
          in the Seven Epistles, are in a more highly developed condition
          than is likely to have been attained at so early a period as the
          close of the sixth decade of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page032">[pg 032]</span><a name="Pg032" id="Pg032" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> Christian era, and the omission of any
          reference to the Apostle Paul as their founder within a
          quarter-century of their establishment would be entirely
          unaccountable; (b) the indications of persecution are better suited
          to the time of Domitian than that of Nero,<a id="noteref_34" name=
          "noteref_34" href="#note_34"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">34</span></span></a> while
          the references to war, famine, and pestilence are equally
          applicable to all the latter part of the first century; (c) the
          advanced stage of the conflict between Christianity and the state
          religion of Rome, shown in the worship of the Beast and the
          antagonism of Babylon, is a strong indication of the later
          date;<a id="noteref_35" name="noteref_35" href=
          "#note_35"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">35</span></span></a> (d)
          the assumed allusions to Nero, and to the temple as still standing,
          depend in each case upon a particular interpretation, and rest upon
          no certain foundation,—or admitting an earlier date for this
          section, it is regarded as having been inserted later,<a id=
          "noteref_36" name="noteref_36" href="#note_36"><span class=

          is a critical guess of uncertain value. This seems to leave the
          balance of evidence upon the side of the later date, though the
          best authorities have formerly been nearly equally divided.</p>

          rocky, and irregularly shaped island, some ten miles long by five
          miles wide, lying in the Ægean Sea, off the coast of Asia Minor,
          about sixty miles from Ephesus and thirty-five miles from
          Miletus,<a id="noteref_37" name="noteref_37" href=

          which John was banished <span class="tei tei-q">“for the Word of
          God and the testimony of Jesus”</span>. According to tradition
          offenders of rank were banished to this island under the Roman
          Empire to work in the mines and marble quarries; and the Apostle
          John perhaps shared in this harsh lot during his imprisonment, as
          asserted by Victorinus in his commentary, the earliest work on the
          Apocalypse, written <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page033">[pg
          033]</span><a name="Pg033" id="Pg033" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          toward the close of the third century. The chief feature of the
          modern island is the Monastery of St. John, founded in A. D. 1088,
          which lies a mile and a half south of La Scala, the landing place;
          while halfway up the hillside a grotto, known as the cave of the
          Apocalypse, is pointed out as the traditional place where the
          visions of the book were seen. The natural scenery of the island is
          rugged and the view of the sea and of the neighboring islands very
          fine, which may have contributed somewhat to the imagery of the
          book, as has been suggested by different travelers.<a id=

          Book of Revelation to a place in the New Testament Canon is well
          attested both historically and by internal evidence. The historical
          evidence is especially complete, and is regarded by some as
          stronger than that of any other book in the New Testament:<a id=

          Evidence covers the question both of authorship and of

          authorship carried with it for the early church the canonicity
          also—and it may be briefly stated as follows, viz:—</p>

          "tei tei-q">“the companion of Polycarp”</span>, regarded it as
          authoritative, and is the first to attest it, though he does not
          affirm its apostolicity. We are indebted for his testimony to
          Andreas of Cappadocia (about the end of the fifth century), who
          refers to Papias along with Irenæus and others, and quotes from a
          work by Papias his comment on Rev. 12:7-9. In this early witness of
          its canonicity we can scarcely conceive of <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page034">[pg 034]</span><a name="Pg034" id="Pg034" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> Papias being mistaken, and his testimony is
          of great value.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(2) Justin
          Martyr (circ. A. D. 140) says it was written by <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“a certain man whose name was John, one of the apostles
          of Christ”</span>. This testimony is within fifty years of the
          later date assigned to the book, and seventy-five years of the
          earlier one, and is therefore of special importance; and there is
          no hesitancy in affirming that the author was <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“one of the apostles of Christ”</span>.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(3) According to
          Eusebius, Melito, Bp. of Sardis (circ. A. D. 170), wrote a lost
          work on <span class="tei tei-q">“the Revelation of John”</span>;
          also two other bishops, Theophilus of Antioch, and Appolonius of
          Ephesus (both before the close of the second century), cited from
          it in their writings.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(4) In a letter
          from the churches of Lyons and Vienne (circ. A. D. 177) the
          Revelation is cited, and is described as <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“sacred Scripture”</span>.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(5) Irenæus
          (circ. A. D. 180) defends its apostolic authority, and asserts
          frequently and positively that the Apocalypse was written by
          <span class="tei tei-q">“John, a disciple of the Lord”</span>.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(6) Clement of
          Alexandria (circ. A. D. 200) refers to the four and twenty elders
          with an explanatory clause, <span class="tei tei-q">“as John says
          in the Apocalypse”</span>.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(7) Tertullian
          (circ. A. D. 200) cites it frequently, ascribing it to John the
          Apostle, and attests its recognition in Africa.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(8) The Canon of
          Muratori (circ. 200) includes it without question, and says,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“John in the Apocalypse, though he writes
          to the Seven Churches, yet says to all, &amp;c,”</span> and the
          context shows that the reference is to the Apostle.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(9) Hippolytus
          (circ. A. D. 210) wrote on <span class="tei tei-q">“the Gospel and
          Apocalypse of John”</span>; and he also cites the Apocalypse as a
          Scripture authority against Caius. After this time its canonicity
          was regarded as established by the Western Church.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(10) Origen
          (circ. A. D. 250), the pupil of Clement of Alexandria, and the
          first textual critic of the New Testament, whose knowledge of the
          opinion and usage in different parts of the church was very wide,
          knows of no doubts concerning the Apocalypse, but quotes it as the
          recognized composition of the Apostle and
          Evangelist.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page035">[pg
          035]</span><a name="Pg035" id="Pg035" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The authority of
          the Apocalypse was not, however, destined to remain unquestioned,
          though its apostolic authorship and canonical right were
          practically unchallenged until toward the end of the second
          century—and in fact it was generally received by the church until
          the middle of the third century—but subsequently both of these were
          questioned, viz:—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(1) Marcion, the
          so-called <span class="tei tei-q">“Heretic”</span> (circ. A. D.
          150), rejected it in forming his Canon because of its apparently
          Jewish character, and not because he did not regard it as genuine.
          This, however, did not represent a church view, and had little
          influence on opinion outside of his own sect.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(2) Dionysius of
          Alexandria (circ. A. D. 247) argues that it is not by the Apostle,
          though he does not reject the book. With him the question is mainly
          one of authorship, and not of canonicity.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(3) Eusebius
          (circ. A. D. 270) follows the opinion of Dionysius and may be
          regarded as <span class="tei tei-q">“wavering”</span>, for he cites
          much in its favor. After Eusebius, however, opposition to it became
          general in the Syro-Palestinian Church, and it does not appear in
          the Peshito Version, though St Ephraim Syrus, the chief father of
          the Syrian Church, cites it and ascribes it to the Apostle
          John.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(4) Cyril of
          Jerusalem (circ. A. D. 386) omits the Apocalypse from his list of
          the canonical books of the New Testament.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(5) In the
          Eastern Church the book was questioned on dogmatic grounds
          connected with the Millenarian controversy, and it was omitted from
          the Canon by the Council of Laodicea (circ. A. D. 360).</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(6) Finally,
          however, in deference to the strong testimony of the Western
          Church, and influenced somewhat, no doubt, by the internal evidence
          of the book itself, it was authoritatively accepted and universally
          recognized by the church at large.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Internal
          Evidence for the canonicity of the book, apart from the
          difficulties discussed under the head of Unity, is quite clear and
          satisfying and is practically irrefutable, for the disputed
          questions of authorship and date are not of such character as to
          affect its canonicity. This evidence may be briefly stated as
          follows, viz:—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(1) The
          historical situation and references correspond to the time in which
          the book claims to have been <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page036">[pg 036]</span><a name="Pg036" id="Pg036" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> written, the latter half of the first
          century, and are fully sustained by contemporaneous history.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(2) The literary
          form and diction are each suitable to the period and authorship to
          which the book is ascribed.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(3) The
          doctrinal teachings are fully and distinctively Christian, and are
          such as we would expect in a work of the period, written by
          inspiration for the whole church, viz:—(a) the Christianity it
          bears witness to has escaped from the particularism of Jewish
          thought into the broad catholicity of the Pauline Epistles; (b)
          Christ is presented as the divine atoning Lamb seated in the midst
          of the throne, co-equal with the Father; (c) the personality of the
          Holy Spirit is recognized, and his illuminative work illustrated;
          (d) the chief duties of the Christian life are those presented in
          the Gospels, faith, witness, and purity, while the reward of
          overcoming is set forth in terms of apostolic hope; and (e) the
          entire contents of the book, so widely different from the
          non-canonical literature, appeal to the instincts of the Christian
          heart now as in the first generation, and verify themselves afresh
          to the Christian consciousness in such a forceful and convincing
          way that this goes far to overcome any apparent objections to its
          canonical authority based upon subjective judgments of another
          class. In fact the impartial verdict of careful investigation
          serves to confirm the opinion that the Apocalypse is rightfully
          received on ample and concurrent testimony both of Historical and
          Internal Evidence as a part of sacred Scripture by the whole church
          throughout the world.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Book
          consists of a series of strange and impressive symbolic visions
          which contrast present and historic conditions of trial and
          suffering in the church and in the world with future and prophetic
          conditions of triumph and reward for the holy and of wrath and
          punishment for the sinful. It is an interpretative view of the
          divine path and plan of the centuries that is evidently given for
          the comfort and help of God's children in the midst of trial and
          distress. Its Literary Form is marked and significant, and belongs
          to that highly figurative style of late Jewish and early Christian
          writings which is known <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page037">[pg
          037]</span><a name="Pg037" id="Pg037" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          as the Apocalyptic Literature.<a id="noteref_41" name="noteref_41"
          href="#note_41"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">41</span></span></a> And
          though John must often have felt himself hampered and impeded by
          the fanciful and more or less unreal character of this literary
          form, yet it doubtless met more fully than any other the conditions
          of the time, and afforded an adequate method of reaching the devout
          Christian mind of that generation. This literature is distinguished
          both by its peculiar style and by the exceptional range of its
          thought, and may be described as consisting of all of that
          particular class of the Apocryphal writings which are couched in
          mystic symbols and figures, and which attempt to give an account of
          hidden things miraculously disclosed, especially those pertaining
          to the other world and to the closing events of human history. The
          word Apocalyptic in its present sense belongs to recent usage,
          being introduced by the modern critical school as a generic term to
          designate these writings as a distinct department of the Apocryphal
          books, and also to denote the literary style or art-form in which
          they are cast. The use of the word Apocalypse to designate the
          writings or books now known by that name (as the <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Apocalypse of
          Baruch</span></span>, and others) is undoubtedly very old, though
          it did not apparently begin before the end of the first century,
          and seems to have taken rise from the common use of the title
          <span class="tei tei-q">“The Apocalypse of John”</span> in
          Christian circles to designate the Revelation, from which the word
          came to be applied to all writings of a similar class. Every
          Apocalypse is thus an example of Apocalyptic; but, owing to the
          late introduction of the latter term as now used, most dictionaries
          do not give an adequate definition.<a id="noteref_42" name=
          "noteref_42" href="#note_42"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">42</span></span></a></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The unique
          symbolism of these writings constitutes their most striking and
          characteristic feature; and it is this uniform use of cryptic
          symbols instead of ordinary figures of speech that invests the
          Apocalypse of John with its peculiar charm, and at the same time
          creates the special problems of its interpretation. A symbol may be
          defined as a conventional objective form chosen to represent
          something else, often not otherwise capable of portraiture, because
          of some real or fancied resemblance <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page038">[pg 038]</span><a name="Pg038" id="Pg038" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> that appeals to the mind; an ideal
          representation couched in sensuous form that embodies one or more
          of the prominent features of its subject, and that comes to
          represent a fixed conception in the world of fancy, a lower and
          material sign being used to represent a higher and abstract idea.
          The use of symbols of some sort is instinctive and universal, and
          grows out of a natural effort of the mind to clothe its ideas in
          forms that give free scope to the imagination. But the peculiar
          nature of the symbols and the profusion of their use in the
          Apocalyptic literature, serve to mark it as separate from all other
          literary forms. Oriental symbols, too, are so unfamiliar and
          oftentimes so incongruous to our minds, such as the Dragon, the
          Scarlet Beast, the Two-horned Beast, and even the Cherubim, that we
          perhaps fail to realize how much they meant to people of a
          primitive civilization who were possessed of a vivid imagination
          without scientific precision of thought. This difference in the
          instinctive appreciation of the nature and value of symbols,
          together with the wide possibilities of meaning that are apparently
          inherent in the symbols used in the Apocalypse, has always given
          room for the fertile fancy of interpreters. But the later study of
          the Apocalyptic writings as a class has made it plain that this
          effort was largely misspent, and has led to more discriminating
          views of the meaning and use of symbols as there found, and to
          their limitation by established usage, where such is known to have
          existed. For while the growth of recognized symbols is necessarily
          slow, and their origin often impossible to trace yet when they have
          once been formed, and have come to possess an established meaning
          in the public mind, they exhibit a remarkable persistence; and
          though their meaning may be somewhat modified by subsequent use and
          by particular application, yet it can scarcely suffer sudden and
          radical change. And let us remember that the symbols, metaphors,
          and other figures found in the Revelation are not purely literary:
          they have had a history and have acquired a recognized and
          conventional meaning. We have, therefore, an available guide to the
          interpretation of the symbols in the book furnished by their use
          not only in the Old Testament, in which by former interpreters they
          were mainly sought, but especially in Jewish apocalypses, which
          give the current meaning of many of them at the time when this book
          was written, a sense which <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page039">[pg 039]</span><a name="Pg039" id="Pg039" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> could not well have been departed from to any
          great extent without making their meaning wholly unintelligible.
          And the more clearly we apprehend this fact, the more constantly we
          apply it in our interpretation, the more likely are we to arrive at
          the meaning intended.<a id="noteref_43" name="noteref_43" href=
          "#note_43"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">43</span></span></a> For
          while the Western mind revolts against the oftime obscurity of
          Apocalyptic symbols, yet we not infrequently recur to the same
          method of illustration. For instance, a good example of the present
          day use of symbols, aided by illustrative skill, is found in such a
          cartoon as <span class="tei tei-q">“The Modern Juggernaut”</span>
          that appeared a few years ago, in which the wheeled car of India
          was transformed into a huge wine bottle full of intoxicating drink
          that rolls along its way, crushing out the lives of thousands of
          miserable victims, while the fierce dogs of War, Famine, and
          Pestilence have under its malign influence slipped their leash and
          go forth to prey upon men.<a id="noteref_44" name="noteref_44"
          href="#note_44"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">44</span></span></a> This
          symbolism in some measure parallels that of the Scarlet Beast in
          the Revelation, and shows how a great destructive force operating
          in the world may be presented to many minds in an objective form
          much more effectively than by any abstract verbal statement. Like a
          parable an apocalypse flings a great truth across our path,
          instinct with the touch of spiritual life.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The revelation
          made to John doubtless took the Apocalyptic form because it was the
          prevailing literary method of that time for the treatment of the
          theme dealt with by his prophecy, and its constructive symbolism
          already filled and colored his thought. But notwithstanding that it
          is cast in a Jewish mould, the Christian thought everywhere
          triumphs over the Jewish form. The line of thought is limited to
          the peculiar range of Apocalyptic subjects, and is found to be
          closely related to that of our Lord's discourse upon the last
          things (the so-called <span class="tei tei-q">“little
          apocalypse”</span> of our Lord in Mat. 24), though it should not be
          regarded as formally an amplification of that discourse, or as
          chiefly or wholly determined in content by <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page040">[pg 040]</span><a name="Pg040" id="Pg040" class=

          "#note_45"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">45</span></span></a> The
          prophetic mood is manifest in every part of the book, and the
          exalted mental state of the writer is sustained throughout after
          the manner of a rhapsody, in the structure and movement of which
          all literary forms are in a measure fused together.<a id=
          "noteref_46" name="noteref_46" href="#note_46"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">46</span></span></a> Indeed
          by a deeper study of this unique work we come to feel as though in
          it <span class="tei tei-q">“we touch the living soul of Asiatic
          Christendom”</span>.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It remains to be
          said that while we class the Apocalypse of John with Jewish
          apocalypses as to literary form, yet it so manifestly rises above
          its class both in method and content that it is universally
          accorded the first place among Apocalyptic writings, and fully
          establishes its claim to a place among the inspired books of
          Scripture by reason of the penetrative prophetic insight which it
          everywhere displays in dealing with the greatest, the most central,
          and the most mysterious theme in the whole sphere of Christian
          thought.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Theme of the
          Revelation, stated in its broadest terms, is Christ and the Church
          through Time to Eternity; the mystery of God in human life and
          history made manifest through the disclosure of the divine
          redemptive plan becoming effective and triumphant.<a id=
          "noteref_47" name="noteref_47" href="#note_47"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">47</span></span></a> The
          theme we assign to the Revelation will, of course, be determined
          largely by our view of its contents. Many interpret it to be
          Jerusalem, Rome, and the End, limiting its outlook to the horizon
          of the early church; others make it the Course of History, or the
          Future Path of the Church in the World; still others affirm it to
          be the Last Things, or the Second Coming of Christ. But the wider
          view is the truer one, which includes many phases of the kingdom,
          and the theme is properly interpreted as Christ and the Church here
          and hereafter, or Redemption in its present and future relation to
          Human Life. This theme is wrought out in prophetic vision by an
          evolving drama that moves forward in multiple and progressive
          cycles of trial and triumph, of conflict and victory, ever
          advancing toward the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page041">[pg
          041]</span><a name="Pg041" id="Pg041" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          complete and final consummation, when righteousness shall win, sin
          be punished, and the redeemed be restored to the immediate presence
          of God; and whereby the divine plan shall be abundantly vindicated
          notwithstanding all apparent anomalies, and seeming contradictions,
          and temporary reverses, for it is confidently affirmed that the
          night of sin shall ultimately pass away, and the day dawn at last
          in which <span class="tei tei-q">“the glory of God and of the Lamb
          shall be the light thereof”</span>; and <span class="tei tei-q">“He
          that sitteth on the throne shall spread his tabernacle over them
          ... that come out of great tribulation”</span>. Thus the book gives
          answer to the deep call of the soul for some sign concerning the
          future that shall point the path of faith and cheer the heart for
          service; and the answer is abundantly satisfying, for those who
          interpret the theme aright. Occupied with such a subject of thought
          it finds its proper place at the end of the inspired volume; it
          forms a fitting close for the entire line of prophetic voices; and
          it binds the long succession of books into an unbroken unity.<a id=

          illimitable sweep its visions look backward through time and
          forward into eternity, downward on earth's struggles and upward
          upon heaven's victory, inward to the soul's conflicts and outward
          to God's eternal peace, while through it all there rings out the
          one transcendent note, Christ reigns but to triumph.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The conditions
          which gave Occasion for this sole Apocalyptic book of the New
          Testament have left their impress on its form and thought, viz.
          persecution from without, and trial and distress within the church.
          These conditions which are subsumed throughout must be clearly
          recognized in order to interpret the message aright, and to
          estimate its proper value for the age which first received it. For,
          whether we accept the earlier or later date of writing, the deadly
          power of the Roman Empire was being put forth to repress and
          destroy the church. At the later date the worship of the Emperor
          was being made the test of obedience to law, and at either time
          many Christians in the face of persecution were weak and wavering.
          The immediate outlook was increasingly dark, and the future
          prospect full of gloom. The failure of the Messiah to reappear and
          of the church to triumph; the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page042">[pg 042]</span><a name="Pg042" id="Pg042" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> bitter experience of persecution already
          endured, and the certainty of greater suffering yet to follow; in a
          word, the apparent reversal of the brightest hopes of early
          Christianity, all of these called for some divine message of cheer
          that would inspirit the discouraged, throw light upon the path of
          sorrow and shame, and make their lot endurable because of the
          assuredly glorious outcome of the future. And there was no kind of
          message so well suited to meet such a crisis as the form of
          Apocalyptic, which grew out of similar conditions, and had a tone
          and temper peculiarly adapted to infuse a triumphant hope in the
          midst of growing religious despair.<a id="noteref_49" name=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">49</span></span></a> But
          let us not fail to perceive that though the Apocalypse was
          specially designed to meet a great crisis in the life of the early
          church, its effectiveness does not end there. Its lessons are for
          us and for all time; it has the course and end of world-history in
          view, and this is an ever-living theme for the church of Christ in
          every age.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Purpose of
          the Apocalypse, as indicated by its introductory words <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The Revelation”</span>, is the revealing or unveiling
          of mystery. In the Christian sense a mystery is a former secret of
          divine truth that has now been at least partially revealed (Eph.
          3:1-11), while an apocalypse is the process of revealing it, and
          also the revelation itself containing the truth made known. The
          comprehensive design of the book is to unfold and interpret the
          divine purpose and method in human history, especially in relation
          to the redemptive process, by portraying in scenic outline the
          present and future course of the church of Christ through conflict
          to victory, for the vindication of God's righteousness in the final
          issue, and for the comfort and encouragement of tried and
          persecuted Christians in the midst of the pathway of life.<a id=
          "noteref_50" name="noteref_50" href="#note_50"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">50</span></span></a> The
          more immediate purpose was to strengthen the church in the strain
          of present distress, while the ultimate aim is to be found not in
          the disclosure of history itself, but in the establishment of the
          moral order of the world, in illustrating the fact that history is
          a divinely guided <span class="tei tei-q">“moral process toward a
          goal”</span>, as the substantial ground of a true philosophy of
          life, and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page043">[pg
          043]</span><a name="Pg043" id="Pg043" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          as a permanent defense against false and partial views. And this
          purpose is so wrought out by the portrayal of the world as an ideal
          battlefield full of opposing forces, with alternating scenes of
          triumph and danger, that the whole becomes a fervent and powerful
          appeal to the heroic in Christian life and character, and a clear
          call to new faith and courage. For whatever else may be its
          lessons, we must not leave out of view this practical purpose of
          divine monition to the world of men, which has so deeply impressed
          itself upon every generation of Christians. Its message of warning
          is inwrought with and reënforced by its prophetic scenes of terror
          and reward: for the Apocalypse is the book of the future as well as
          of the past and present, and that future is ever near in prophetic
          vision, however far it may be in historic relation, and to John's
          eye is always filled with the figure of the returning Christ who
          comes to judgment and to victory. The message, however, viewed in
          its entirety, while it contains a sympathetic element of
          encouragement for the saints, and a monitory element of exhortation
          and warning for all men, is yet fundamentally a philosophic
          interpretation of the divine method in history for all who would
          see God in the story of man's life on the earth—a theodicy based
          upon prophecy. And any view which assumes for the author a narrow
          field of vision, such as that he merely grouped together the
          current apocalyptic conceptions of his time in order to fling them
          in fierce polemic against the Roman Empire and to foreshadow its
          defeat and fall,<a id="noteref_51" name="noteref_51" href=
          "#note_51"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">51</span></span></a> rests
          upon a manifestly imperfect judgment that fails in religious depth,
          missing the spiritual significance of the message, and lacks in
          literary insight, denying the evident marks of originality, genius,
          and inspiration in the most wonderful and unique composition of its
          kind that has ever been produced.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There are two
          essentially different methods of Interpretation that have been
          followed in attempting to arrive at the meaning of this manifestly
          difficult book, which are founded upon different conceptions of its
          didactic purpose, and proceed upon different lines of inquiry, viz.
          the Historical, and the Symbolical.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Historical
          Interpretation regards the book as a <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">prophetic review and
          forecast of history</span></span> veiled in symbol, <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page044">[pg 044]</span><a name="Pg044" id="Pg044"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and seeks the meaning and fulfilment of
          the visions in certain specific historical events which either have
          occurred, are occurring, or will occur within the sphere of human
          life and experience. There are three different forms of this method
          of interpretation, all of which specialize the prophecy but differ
          as to the time and nature of the fulfilment, viz. (1) the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Preterist</span></span> view (also called the
          Contemporaneous-Historical), which regards that the visions relate
          mainly to events in the history of the early church, and that they
          have been already fulfilled in the far past; (2) the <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Futurist</span></span> view (also called the
          Future-Historical), that the visions relate mainly to events which
          shall occur in the last days, and that the fulfilment is to be
          looked for chiefly in the more or less remote future; and (3) the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Progressivist</span></span> view (also called
          the Continuous- or Church-Historical), that the several visions
          constitute a continuous and progressive series, covering the whole
          period of the church's history from the time of John to the last
          judgment, and that their fulfilment is therefore to be found in a
          successive line of historical events, part of which lie in the past
          and part in the future.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Symbolical
          Interpretation, upon the other hand, regards the book as a
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">prophetic
          idealization of history</span></span>, dealing with the general
          course and outcome of man's life upon the earth, and disclosing
          under the form of symbols the spiritual and moral forces which give
          to history its deeper meaning; and seeks the significance and
          fulfilment of the visions not, therefore, in particular events, but
          rather in classes of events, not solely at one definite time, but
          at many different times, finding the revelation mainly illustrative
          of general principles of the divine government rather than
          predictive of particular facts of history, a view of various phases
          rather than of historic stages of the church's experience,<a id=

          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">52</span></span></a> and
          interpreting its symbols in the genuine spirit of Apocalyptic as
          pictorial representations of the prevailing fortunes of the church
          in the world as she moves forward to the final consummation.<a id=
          "noteref_53" name="noteref_53" href="#note_53"><span class=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">53</span></span></a> This
          method of interpretation, which is commonly known as <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page045">[pg 045]</span><a name="Pg045" id="Pg045"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Symbolist</span></span> view (also called the
          Spiritual), presents no such marked difference of form as the
          Historical, but with a wider outlook regards that the visions
          relate to all such like events in every age as specially manifest
          God's rule in the world sending forth judgment unto victory, and
          such as particularly exhibit the progressive development of good
          and evil in human life, together with their constant conflict and
          their final reward and punishment.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All the current
          interpretations may be classified under one or other of the above
          heads, yet in the hands of individual interpreters they are often
          modified and blend into each other in their application—a manifest
          recognition of the fact that there is an element of truth
          underlying each view, which we may perhaps say has been unduly
          emphasized, for all agree that the interpretation is somehow and
          somewhere to be found in human life and history.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">What might be
          called still another method of interpretation is the
          Apocalyptic-Traditional (or Tradition-Historical) view of late
          critical writers on the Apocalypse already referred to, which
          approaches the question from the viewpoint of literary origin, and
          attributes certain portions of the book to the introduction of
          traditional Jewish or Jewish-Christian Apocalyptic fragments that
          have been utilized by the author and applied to the historical
          conditions of his time, adapting them to a new meaning. This,
          however, is not so much a separate method of interpretation as it
          is a corollary of the present Literary-Critical method of dealing
          with the book, which regards it as an early Christian work in
          successive editions that has taken into itself certain Jewish
          elements. With this origin assumed the interpretation does not
          differ materially from the Preterist view except, perhaps, that it
          is less rigorous in its application to current events, and
          recognizes more fully the idealism of the author; for the
          historical outlook has measurably lost its value except as an
          indication of the date of writing, and for most who hold this view
          the book has no longer any distinctive prophetic message for the
          church; it has become chiefly a fantastic dream, a pious dream it
          is true, but only a dream of the far past.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The principal
          question of interpretation, as will be seen by a consideration of
          the current views, relates not only to the view-point, but also to
          the aim or design of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page046">[pg
          046]</span><a name="Pg046" id="Pg046" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          Revelation. The Historical method centers the chief aim of the book
          in a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">predictive</span></span>-prophetic element
          which it finds throughout and regards as pointing to specific
          events in particular periods of history that are designed to teach
          important spiritual lessons. With this idea of the didactic
          purpose, it yet presents the widest variation of opinion concerning
          the viewpoint of the book, and includes upon the one hand the
          extreme rationalist who considers it a purely human writing, a
          Jewish apocalypse that has been revamped to include Christian
          ideas, which blends history with prediction and reflects only the
          horizon of the first century; and on the other hand the devout
          mystic who accepts its message as chiefly predictive prophecy of
          the far future, and interprets it well nigh literally as a
          prophetic account of the world's ending amid terror and blood. The
          Symbolist method, with a quite different conception, centers the
          aim of the book in an <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">interpretative</span></span>-prophetic element
          which it finds in every part, and regards as setting forth the
          principles of the divine government, and pointing to their
          exemplification in multiple events occurring in different periods
          of history that are working together toward the final consummation.
          According to this method of interpretation the viewpoint is
          idealistic, universal, and timeless, and the scope of the visions
          correspondingly wide.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The latter view,
          which is the one presented in the following outline, affords a
          fairly satisfactory interpretation that has been steadily gaining
          ground during the last half-century, and to the present author
          seems destined in some form to attain general though perhaps not
          universal acceptance. The views of the leaders in the symbolical
          school present no material divergence in general
          interpretation,<a id="noteref_54" name="noteref_54" href=
          "#note_54"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">54</span></span></a> and
          the principles of this interpretation seem likely to prevail
          throughout the Christian church of the future, though the form and
          application may be somewhat modified. The objection that
          <span class="tei tei-q">“this system of interpretation is out of
          keeping with the general purpose of Apocalyptic
          literature”</span>,<a id="noteref_55" name="noteref_55" href=
          "#note_55"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">55</span></span></a> loses
          its force if we grant that the book is inspired, and realize that
          the literary form was chosen because of its adaptability for the
          treatment of the topics dealt with in the Apocalypse; for once, the
          Apocalyptic form becomes the vehicle of a divine revelation, it
          thereby escapes some of the main limitations of its class, one

          "Pg047" id="Pg047" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of which was
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the consciousness of no new message from
          God for the generation to which it was addressed”</span>; and
          accordingly it should here be regarded as only the literary setting
          in which the message continually overtops the form, the art-form in
          which the art is lost sight of through the beauty and power of the
          truth which it presents. This view, although not without
          difficulties, is yet believed by a good proportion of eminent
          scholars to be based upon sound and temperate exegesis, to be best
          suited to the character of the book, and to give relative value to
          all the elements of truth contained in other views. The importance
          of the historical situation of John's time and of the lessons for
          that age is fully recognized, the eschatological element throughout
          is given due consideration, and the application of the prophecy to
          the entire trend and events of history is made apparent, while the
          precise time-relation of the visions is for the most part
          eliminated, and thus the field of prophetic prospective is
          maintained in its true breadth, and not narrowed as in the
          historical interpretation to a particular age or series of events.
          And the interpretation as a whole rests for its validity upon the
          scope and tenor of the book throughout, and can therefore be
          maintained without determining the full or specific meaning of
          every part. The Revelation thus understood ceases to be either a
          political diatribe of the first century, or the terrored story of
          the End; it rises above an epitome of history whether near or far,
          and takes rank as a true prophetic book in Apocalyptic form,
          dealing with the all-embracing plan of God for the ages, and the
          munificent purpose of redemption; and it is thereby rescued from
          many conjectural and contradictory interpretations which have
          obscured its meaning, and becomes a living prophecy of value to the
          church in every age.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The tendency
          toward wiser methods in the interpretation of the Apocalypse, and
          the growing spirit of unanimity concerning its larger lessons,
          provide good ground for encouragement to the troubled reader. And
          while, no doubt, the influence of the individual type of mind will
          continue to be felt in the interpretation, the rationalistic
          emphasizing the preterist application, the mystic the futurist, and
          the practical mind the symbolic and universal reference, yet it
          should always be kept in view that the chief importance of the book
          for the church at large <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page048">[pg
          048]</span><a name="Pg048" id="Pg048" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          transcends any question of theoretical interpretation, and lies in
          its practical worth in providing a rich source of religious
          inspiration, an invigorating aid to imperfect faith, and an abiding
          stimulus to the Christian imagination, in enabling the ordinary
          mind to realize the spiritual in the midst of and transcending the
          natural, and in making the deep conflict of life with its divine
          superintendence an ever present fact to the human soul. Indeed the
          book was evidently written for common use in the early church in
          public worship (ch. 1:3), which indicates an appreciation of its
          value in striking contrast with the modern indifference that passes
          it by as unintelligible. The Apocalypse has also a historical
          value, quite apart from its general meaning and use, that we should
          not overlook, for it throws important light upon the political and
          social conditions as well as the inner thought and development of
          the Christian church in the latter part of the first century. It
          reflects throughout the faith and temper in which the early church
          faced its growing conflict with the world. And it serves to show
          that at the close of the apostolic age there was a Christianity
          which was free from the law and universal, and yet continued to
          adhere to Jewish modes of expression.<a id="noteref_56" name=

          <span style="font-size: 144%">14. The Literary
          Structure.</span></h2>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The elaborate
          and artistic Literary Structure of the Apocalypse, the numerical
          symmetry of its parts, the parallelism of its visions, and the
          recurrent climaxes in its development, together unite to give it a
          unique place among the writings of Scripture; and a clear
          perception of these relations becomes a distinct aid to the better
          understanding of its message, for these belong to it as the outer
          robes which enfold its inner thought. The predominance of the
          number seven in the arrangement of its subject-matter throughout,
          especially the recurrence of formal series of sevens in the
          Epistles, Seals, Trumpets, and Vials, has commonly led to the
          conclusion that the book is somehow capable of division into seven
          parts fundamental to its structure. And although the failure of
          commentators to agree generally upon any lines of division yet
          proposed scarcely seems to support this opinion, yet the possible
          correctness and the general helpfulness of such a division is fully
          recognized. Any such division which we may make, however, is
          chiefly one of analysis, for the visions are continuous and develop
          without any distinctive break of prophetic view. The outline
          analysis given above divides the Visions, or main portion of the
          book, into seven parts, the Episodes being made parenthetical and
          subordinate, as their contents and connection serve to indicate;
          while the four subdivisions of the Introduction and three of the
          Conclusion taken together, form another seven. This general
          division, which is not an uncommon one, agrees in the main, though
          not in statement or in full detail, with that in the <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pulpit
          Commentary</span></span>,<a id="noteref_57" name="noteref_57" href=
          "#note_57"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          one of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page050">[pg
          050]</span><a name="Pg050" id="Pg050" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          the most natural as well as the most helpful in bringing out the
          chief thought of the book. The carefully wrought out and remarkably
          suggestive division and subdivision into complete series of sevens,
          given in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Modern Reader's Bible</span></span>,<a id=
          "noteref_58" name="noteref_58" href="#note_58"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">58</span></span></a> after
          the same manner as the Prophecy of Ezekiel, and the Rhapsody of
          Joel, is worthy of attentive consideration, though it may well be
          doubted whether such an extensive subdivision found place in the
          Apocalyptist's thought.<a id="noteref_59" name="noteref_59" href=
          "#note_59"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">59</span></span></a> With
          discriminative literary insight the author of that work says,
          concerning the general outline of the book, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The seven visions of St. John's Revelation seem in the
          line of their succession to trace the figure of an arch, the
          keystone of the arch being the master-thought of the prophecy;...
          On either side of it [in the arrangement of the visions] III is
          closely parallel with V, and II with VI ... while I and VII are
          separate from the rest.... As always, literary form is here
          pointing to the deepest spiritual meaning”</span>. The theme of the
          central vision according to this view, is <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Salvation: the Kingdom of this World becoming the
          Kingdom of Christ”</span>, which puts the purpose of the Christian
          warfare to the front, and has much to commend it; for the warfare
          is in order that the redemptive purpose of God may become effective
          and triumphant. There are reasons, however, in the scheme of the
          book which seem to place the main emphasis upon the warfare itself
          as leading to salvation, and that view has been accepted in this
          work. Following the fertile suggestion given above, though with a
          somewhat different conception of the theme of the several visions,
          we arrive at the following outline of the thought and plan of the
          chief part of the book,<a id="noteref_60" name="noteref_60" href=
          "#note_60"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          corresponding to Triumph, Trial to Vindication, and Threatening to
          Judgment, vision IV, that of Warfare, holding the balance between
          them: while if we regard the central vision in relation to the
          rest, we find the arrangement to be one of <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">climax</span></em>,
          vision IV forming the connecting link between I and VII, II and VI,
          and III and V, the visions preceding and following it forming an
          ascending and descending scale to and from the center, viz. that of
          Sovereignty leading through Warfare to Triumph, that of Trial
          through Warfare to Vindication, and that of Threatening through
          Warfare to Judgment. The movement of thought is thereby indicated
          to be from the throne challenged to the throne triumphant, from the
          church tried to the church vindicated, from the world threatened to
          the world judged, through a world-conflict which forms the acme of
          the dramatic purpose, and discloses the entire sweep of redemptive
          history as buttressed upon the eternal throne. The seven visions,
          according to this view, are not bound together by any temporal
          succession, but each displays a world-process complete in itself,
          and they are so arranged that the climax is reached at the center
          instead of the end, after the analogy of Hebrew poetry, the central
          vision furnishing the key to the interpretation of the whole.<a id=

          value of such an analytic interpretation, when sustained by the
          contents of the book, lies not alone in the help which it affords
          in penetrating the deeper purpose of the writer, and of the
          revelation made through him, but in the illuminative effect which,
          in a case like this, it throws upon the disputed question of unity;
          for if any such clearly marked and continuous current of thought
          can be shown to thread its way throughout the entire book, despite
          all by-currents and eddies, then the various theories of diverse or
          composite authorship cease to be credible except to pure
          theorists.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Literature
          relating to this difficult book is very extensive, more works,
          strange to say, having been written on the Apocalypse which has
          been so imperfectly understood than upon any other part of
          Scripture, though many of them are now rightly regarded as of
          little value. A careful study of one or more of the leading
          authorities representing each of the current methods of
          interpretation will give a fair view of the whole field, and will
          serve to show that in many points there is essential agreement
          among all schools of thought, though for advanced work one's
          reading must necessarily cover a wider range, for the student
          should then know all the best that has been said upon the problems
          of the book. The most important qualification, however, for this
          difficult study is to approach the whole subject with an open mind
          and a fresh spirit of inquiry, resolved to be quite untrammelled by
          traditional interpretations, to investigate with scrupulous care
          the various points of view, and to apply with fearless courage all
          the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">well-established</span></em> results of
          investigation, especially those of the later fruitful studies in
          Apocalyptic literature, which enable us to approach more nearly the
          viewpoint of the earliest readers of the book, but which yet remain
          to be duly correlated with our previous knowledge, being
          confidently assured that there is <span class="tei tei-q">“light
          yet to break”</span> for the earnest soul upon the deep things of
          the Apocalypse.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is not likely
          that any one commentary will prove entirely satisfactory to the
          thoughtful reader, owing to the wide variation of opinion upon many
          minor points among those holding the same general view. Milligan is
          very suggestive though not always convincing, for he is oftentimes
          too indefinite in interpretation to be satisfying to the reader,
          telling us that <span class="tei tei-q">“no detail of historic
          events need be looked for”</span>. His discussion of principles,
          however, is always illuminative, even when his application is not
          quite so clear; and not infrequently his work is of more value in
          showing the inconclusiveness of other views than in establishing
          his own. We are indebted to him, through the general circulation of
          his works, perhaps more than to any other writer, for the present
          prevalence of the symbolic view in the English speaking world, and
          his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Lectures</span></span>, and one or other of
          his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Commentaries</span></span>, should be read by
          every student. Plummer, in the <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pulpit</span>
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page053">[pg 053]</span><a name=
          "Pg053" id="Pg053" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Commentary</span></span>, will be found more
          satisfactory by the general reader, especially if he inclines to
          the symbolic interpretation, and there is, in fact, no better
          commentary for common use, though we may not agree with all his
          conclusions. To his wise and discriminative judgment the present
          author wishes to express a deep indebtedness. The short
          introduction to that volume, with its scholarly notes on
          manuscripts, versions, &amp;c, will also be found very helpful to
          the busy student. Farrar, supporting the preterist view, gives the
          historical conditions of the Neronic period in a striking way, many
          of which are equally applicable to the whole latter part of the
          first century. Lee is especially valuable for the condensed
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">résumé</span></span> of opinions concerning
          many obscure passages throughout the book, though the great
          diversity of views at times presented is apt to be confusing.
          Faussett is excellent from his point of view, ranking among the
          best premillennial interpreters. Seiss is also a popular authority
          with those who share the premillennial expectation, but his
          exegesis is often faulty, and his interpretation fanciful.
          Moulton's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Modern Reader's Bible</span></span> vol. John,
          is indispensable for its literary analysis and aid in gaining the
          general perspective, and should be in the library of every student.
          The Introduction to Revelation in the <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">New Century
          Bible</span></span>, by C. A. Scott, gives an admirable and concise
          statement of the present status of opinion concerning the problems
          of the book, and the notes of the same volume are especially
          valuable for their references to Jewish Apocalyptic. This is the
          best small book for the use of the student who wishes to get an
          outline of the modern view concerning the incorporation of Jewish
          apocalypses. For those who are acquainted with the Greek text,
          Alford, Stuart, and Düsterdieck will be found quite helpful, even
          though they belong to a former generation, for each has a special
          excellency; but the late work of Swete, the <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Apocalypse of St.
          John</span></span> (1906), which is both thorough and scholarly, is
          indispensable for the critical use of the student in that it meets
          more fully the questions of modern inquiry and present discussion,
          and maintains a moderate view of the opinions now to the fore
          concerning the origin of the book. On the other hand Briggs'
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Messiah
          of the Gospels</span></span>, and Moffatt's <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Historical New
          Testament</span></span> give a good account of late theories of
          composite authorship and deserve attention. Also the able work of
          Moffatt on Revelation in the final volume of the <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Expositor's Greek
          Testament</span></span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page054">[pg
          054]</span><a name="Pg054" id="Pg054" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          has been issued (1910), and deserves careful notice. The author
          adopts the modern critical view, that portions of the book have
          been incorporated from current apocalypses, and devotes
          considerable attention to source-criticism as an aid to
          interpretation, but too much time is given to pointing out what he
          regards as parallel thought in Greek, Roman, and Jewish writings,
          and this often has little interpretative value. The work is adapted
          to the ripe scholar rather than the earlier student, and though
          rejecting extreme views, it will not be found altogether satisfying
          to those of more conservative mind who believe that the Apocalypse
          is entitled to a primary rather than a secondary place among the
          books of Scripture. Another work awaited with much interest is the
          volume on Revelation in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">International Critical
          Commentary</span></span> which is in course of preparation by
          Charles, the eminent authority upon Apocalyptic.<a id="noteref_62"
          name="noteref_62" href="#note_62"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">62</span></span></a> This
          volume when issued will no doubt add much of value to the modern
          point of view, and serve to throw additional light upon the
          relations of Apocalyptic literature to this its greatest
          masterpiece. His <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Studies in the Apocalypse</span></span> (1913)
          serves to indicate the general line of interpretation to be
          expected, and it must be said that this is somewhat disappointing
          to the conservative reader, for it is highly critical. One
          naturally hesitates to disagree so widely with such an eminent
          scholar and distinguished apocalyptist as has been found necessary
          to do in the following pages; but it should be remembered that all
          Scripture is written for the world of men, and that the opinion of
          no one scholar or number of scholars can authoritatively determine
          the meaning of any part of it, but that rather the interpretation
          must be arrived at by a general consensus of opinion among men of
          learning and piety throughout the world. That this opinion, though
          now veering toward the critical view, will not be eventually
          sustained by more thorough research is the confirmed judgment of
          many scholars. But with it all there are many points of
          interpretation formerly in dispute that may now be regarded as
          already settled, their essential meaning in any case being
          substantially the same, and thus the book so long aglow with
          mysteries has virtually become every man's book in the light of
          intelligent interpretation.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Finally, with
          special emphasis it should be said, that it is of prime importance
          for those who would understand <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page055">[pg 055]</span><a name="Pg055" id="Pg055" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> the Apocalypse in its proper relations to
          Biblical thought, that a careful study should be made of the
          prophecies of Daniel, Ezekiel, Zechariah, Isaiah, Amos, Joel, and
          Habakkuk, together with the Book of Psalms, in connection with the
          Revelation, in order to catch the inner thought of the book; also
          of some portion of the Apocalyptic literature, particularly the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Book of
          Enoch</span></span>,<a id="noteref_63" name="noteref_63" href=
          "#note_63"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">63</span></span></a> the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Apocalypse of Baruch</span></span>, and the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Fourth
          Book of Ezra</span></span>, for these will furnish the atmosphere
          of Jewish thought in which the Apocalypse was conceived, and will
          provide substantial aid in understanding the peculiarities of its
          literary form and the general spirit of the work, as well as in
          freeing the mind from the trammels of traditional interpretation.
          But, above all, we should not forget that the book of Revelation is
          a properly recognized part of canonical Scripture in practically
          the universal judgment of the entire Christian world, and that
          notwithstanding its many and persistent difficulties of
          interpretation, it is yet entitled to our earnest study and
          attentive thought as containing a living and abiding message from
          Almighty God, through his Son Jesus Christ our Lord to John the
          last of the apostles, and through him to the sin-burdened souls of
          men the world over.</p>

                  the four angels that are bound at the great river

                  been prepared for the hour and day and month and year, that
                  they should kill the third part of men. 16 And the number
                  of the armies of the horsemen was twice ten thousand times
                  ten thousand: I heard the number of them. 17 And thus I saw
                  the horses in the vision, and them that sat on them, having

                  as the heads of lions; and out of their mouths proceedeth
                  fire and smoke and brimstone. 18 By these three plagues was
                  the third part of men killed, by the fire and the smoke and
                  the brimstone, which proceeded out of their mouths. 19 For
                  the power of the horses is in their mouth, and in their
                  tails: for their tails are like unto serpents, and have
                  heads; and with them they hurt. 20 And the rest of mankind,

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Book of
        Revelation bears the inherent marks of a thoroughly wrought out and
        carefully finished literary production, showing evident traces of
        design and arrangement throughout, which constitute a studied setting
        for the remarkable series of visions that contain its chief message
        to the church. Behind the outer form lies the deep experience of the
        author who received a fresh revelation of divine truth. To him God
        spoke in strange visions and in a marvellous way about the divine
        purpose concerning his people and the great world of men: for couched
        though it is in the strange figures of Apocalyptic, a method of
        religious thought belonging to that time, it yet bears to the
        Christian mind indisputable marks of divine inspiration. Moved by the
        visions which it records, John wrote to the churches in Asia a
        message not only for them but for all believers in all time; for its
        lessons lie not alone in the events of that age, but in the wider and
        permanent relations of the church and the world throughout the
        centuries, and they appeal to us with new force as the varying
        conditions continue to change with the revolving years. The lessons
        of the book are for us in our day no less than they have been for
        others in the past, and as they will be for still others in the
        advancing future; and though these lessons are not always easy to
        grasp or lightly to be understood, they are yet eminently worthy of
        our attentive study and patient consideration. The synthetic analysis
        which is here given, attempts to set forth the main thought of the
        Revelation as it has been interpreted by many eminent commentators,
        and it is presented in as concise a form as is consistent with
        clearness for the benefit of the general reader, for the chief
        purpose of the present work is to make plain the symbolic view as it
        has taken form in the mind of the writer. No extended discussion of
        the more difficult portions of the book has been attempted, for a
        satisfactory conclusion is more often reached by careful thought than
        by elaborate argument, though it has seemed best to reinforce the
        view presented by constant reference to well-known authorities, and
        also to provide a brief comparison of different opinions on the main
        points of disagreement for those who desire further
        study.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page092">[pg

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The book is found
        upon examination to consist of three principal parts, which are those
        common to every finished composition, viz:—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This division is
        one generally accepted by those who have studied the book, for it is
        to most minds both natural and obvious, though some make the
        Introduction end with the first chapter, and include the Epistles to
        the Churches in the second part. As these, however, are not so
        markedly Apocalyptic in form as the chapters that follow, and do not
        enter into the chief message of the book, but rather serve to prepare
        the way for it, they are more properly regarded as part of the
        Introduction.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The introductory
          and epistolary portions of the book which occupy the first three
          chapters, consist of four parts, viz. the superscription, the
          salutation, a vision of the exalted Redeemer, and messages to the
          seven churches in Asia. These give the source and authority of the
          Revelation, convey a greeting to the seven churches that are named,
          set forth the present activity of Christ in his redemptive work
          with the certainty of his personal return, and then present
          particular messages to each of the churches in Asia, which through
          their general condition afford a perspective view of the continuous
          and varied experience of the whole church in the process of
          redemption. These preliminary parts of the book, also, serve to
          introduce the great theme which is to occupy the subsequent
          revelation, viz. Christ and the Church through Time to Eternity.
          The style is at once that of Apocalyptic, though the form is less
          characteristic in the second and third chapters than in the first
          and subsequent ones; the literary construction is marked by obvious
          and sustained artistic skill; and the subject-matter shows a
          profound inner connection of thought with the visions that follow,
          affording a clear indication of the unity of the whole work that
          should not be overlooked in our study of the book.<a id=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the
            superscription the book is described, its history and contents
            are given (v. 1-2), and a blessing is pronounced (v. 3) upon
            those who read it, i. e. aloud before the congregation
            (ἀναγινώσκων), and those who hear and keep the things written
            therein, an indication that they were expected to be understood.
            This blessing is the first of seven beatitudes found in the book
            (see <a href="#Appendix_C" class="tei tei-ref">App'x C</a>), and
            serves to show that the office of public reader in the primitive
            church was established in the first century, evidently because of
            a general lack of education among the early converts. The book is
            declared to be the Revelation or Apocalypse of things about to
            happen,—not a revelation which has Jesus Christ for its
            subject,<a id="noteref_301" name="noteref_301" href=

            (cf. Lu. 18:8), and not to be taken in the stricter sense of
            limiting the prophecy to the immediate future,<a id="noteref_302"

            These introductory verses (v. 1-3) are usually regarded as an
            integral part of the book, though they are thought by some to
            have been added afterward as an introduction and authorization by
            the church, probably by the elders at Ephesus.<a id="noteref_305"

            descriptive phrase <span class="tei tei-q">“the firstborn of the
            dead”</span> is an evident recognition of Christ as the first to
            conquer death by resurrection. The closing part of the salutation
            (v. 7-8) is exclamatory and parenthetical, and forms a kind of
            prelude to all that follows, affirming the certainty of the
            second advent as if already present, and introducing at this
            point the divine witness, which is generally attributed to Christ
            who speaks as God, affirming himself to be the source and end of
            all things, the Eternal and All-Ruler, whose word stands as
            surety for the fulfilment of the visions. The fact of God as
            All-Ruler (Παντοκράτωρ, <span class="tei tei-q">“the

            the realization of that fact in history, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“constitutes the deep undertone which pervades every
            part of the Apocalypse, and rises here and there into its

            the Old Testament, and well understood as belonging only to the
            Divine Being, are freely used of Christ in the Revelation,
            showing how fully his divine nature was realized in that stage of
            the church's experience. The connection of the eighth verse may
            properly be considered as the answering voice of Christ to the
            cry of John in the seventh, <span class="tei tei-q">“Behold he

              Son of Man is majestic in form and mien, and wondrous in
              appearance, like the Ancient of Days in Daniel's vision (Dan.
              7.9f), his head and hair like wool in purity and majesty, his
              eyes penetrating and enkindling as a flame of fire, his feet
              awe-striking and destructive like molten brass glowing in a
              furnace, his voice sounding like the roar of cataracts, and his
              countenance like to the unclouded sun—symbols all of these of
              his exalted state, and perhaps intended to present a
              reminiscence of the transfiguration. The Greek word
              Χαλκολίβανος (v. 15), translated <span class=
              "tei tei-q">“burnished brass”</span> by the Revisers, is of
              unknown origin, and occurs only here and in ch. 2:18. It is
              thought to have been a technical term in local use among the
              metal workers of Ephesus, and to apply to some alloy of copper
              or brass.<a id="noteref_316" name="noteref_316" href=

              The literal interpretation of the word is <span class=

              for making utensils in which to burn incense, evidently
              precious, and having a glow in the furnace, or like a
              furnace.</p>

              It will be seen that the seven angels, which stand as the ideal
              representatives of the churches throughout the first part of
              the Revelation, are here presented under another symbol, as
              seven stars which are upheld in the hand of Christ <span class=
              "tei tei-q">“like a chain of glittering jewels”</span>, thereby
              showing his sustaining care of the churches. The angels of the
              churches that are symbolized by the stars, are not to be
              regarded as true angelic beings any more than the stars are
              real stars, but are the churches themselves personified by
              angelic forms after the manner of the Apocalyptic. The figure
              is not properly applicable to the bishops, pastors, or leaders
              of the churches, though often so interpreted, for these are
              leaders upon earth, whereas the angels like the stars belong in
              heaven.<a id="noteref_318" name="noteref_318" href=

              mysterious and hidden future of the church of Christ in the
              world which the seven churches represent in its ideal
              unity.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The change
              of symbols in this vision is apt to be confusing unless we
              catch the distinctive meaning of each. Three different symbols
              are here used to represent the churches, each presenting a
              different point of view, viz:—(1) the angels, who represent the
              churches in their individual and organic life, engaged in
              active service for God; (2) the stars, which represent the
              churches in their relation to Christ, receiving and reflecting
              light from him and upheld by his hand; and (3) the
              candlesticks, which represent the churches in their relation to
              the world, bearing light to men upon the earth. If these
              distinctions are kept in mind the interpretation will be
              greatly simplified. At this point it may also be well to note
              that the view which regards the visions in the Revelation as
              purely literary in origin, fails to satisfy the circumstantial
              account of John. On the contrary we find it is more in accord
              with the spirit of the record to regard them not as literary
              inventions in which the message is clothed, but as true visions
              divinely given which were, nevertheless, essentially adapted to
              and conditioned by the previous mental training and habits of
              the writer—the product of an ethical and not a magical
              inspiration. In fact the reality of the visions is in some
              sense coming now to be recognized upon psychological grounds as
              the natural view.<a id="noteref_322" name="noteref_322" href=

              And it should also be seen that the studied literary setting of
              the visions, indicating arrangement and design upon
              <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page099">[pg 099]</span><a name=
              "Pg099" id="Pg099" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the part of the
              seer in his record of them, does not militate against the view
              that the visions were real and the experience recorded an
              actual one. But, <span class="tei tei-q">“even were the
              supposition correct that the seer had only certain truths
              divinely impressed upon his mind, which his poetic fancy led
              him to clothe in the shapes before us, it would in no degree
              modify either the extent of his inspiration or the value of his

            letters in an apocalypse was foreign to the Jewish method of
            writing, but was doubtless introduced by John because the use of
            such letters or epistles had already become established in the

            through their individual experience <span class="tei tei-q">“to
            exemplify the experience of the whole church in the field of
            history”</span>; not, however, in numerically successive and
            historic stages, but the general experience of the church
            universal throughout all time, for seven is the symbol of
            universality, and the seven churches are here intended to
            symbolize the universal church. Each of the seven churches named
            occupied a strategic point of special opportunity for gospel
            dispersion, and they were doubtless addressed for that reason,
            though the message imparted was divinely intended for the whole
            church in all the ages. The number seven occurs so often in the
            Revelation that it necessarily attracts our attention, and the
            book itself has not inaptly been styled <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“the Book of Sevens”</span>. <span class="tei tei-pb"
            id="page100">[pg 100]</span><a name="Pg100" id="Pg100" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> In each case, too, as here, the number has
            a symbolic reference, a fact that should not escape our
            observation, for it points the way to a general principle of
            interpretation, viz. that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">every number used throughout the book,
            without exception, has an acquired symbolical
            meaning</span></span>,<a id="noteref_327" name="noteref_327"
            href="#note_327"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

            e. its ordinary arithmetical value is ignored, or becomes
            subordinate, and it represents a different idea that has in some
            way become associated with it as a number; and this important
            consideration often furnishes a key to the correct
            interpretation. The origin of this symbolism is very early,
            antedating history—seven, for example, was a sacred number with
            the Accadian predecessors of the Semites in the remote dawn of
            Babylonian civilization.<a id="noteref_328" name="noteref_328"
            href="#note_328"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">328</span></span></a>
            This use probably had its rise from observations of the heavenly
            bodies, such as the phases of the moon lasting seven days, the
            seven planets of ancient astronomy, and the Pleiades, together
            with the occurrence of seven as a factor in gestation and in
            other well known phenomena, all of which served to impress upon
            the Eastern mind that the number was somehow inwrought in the
            order of nature and must therefore have a special significance.
            In a similar way the number ten probably had its origin as a
            symbol in the fact that it represented the complete number of
            digits on a man's hands, and formed the norm of mathematical
            reckoning. Other numbers, also, from some real or fancied
            relation to things, became ready symbols for the Oriental mind.
            In the Apocalypse numbers are often introduced first in their
            ordinary significance, as the seven churches, and then pass
            easily and naturally to their symbolic meaning which is usually
            apparent. But it should be seen that a number does not thereby
            cease to have a quantitative value when it becomes symbolical, e.
            g. the seven churches represent a number still, though it is the
            number of all the churches, the whole church, and not seven units
            as before. It is the definite numerical value only that is lost
            in the symbolism, and not the entire idea of number or quantity;
            and the failure to recognize this fact may lead us astray in the
            interpretation, as for instance, in that of the thousand years in
            chapter twenty, where a great and complete number of years seems
            to be meant, and not the completeness of Satan's <span class=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Each epistle
            is addressed to the angel of the individual church which is
            named, i. e. to its heavenly representative, the church
            personified in the form of an angel according to the prevailing
            symbolism of the book, a poetic form of addressing the church
            itself; and the message is given by authority of Christ
            himself,<a id="noteref_330" name="noteref_330" href=

            is described in veiled terms that are drawn mainly from the
            imagery of the preceding vision, where the exalted Redeemer is so
            vividly set forth; and the terms are aptly chosen to suit the
            particular needs of the church to which it is sent. It has been
            suggested, also, that these epistles to the churches contain
            numerous historical allusions to events connected with the cities
            in which the churches were located, as for example Sardis, whose
            fortress had been twice captured while its people slept, is
            exhorted to be watchful.<a id="noteref_331" name="noteref_331"

            epistles are addressed first to the individual and historic
            churches named, and then through them are addressed to the whole
            church throughout the world, of which the number seven is
            representative. Each of the epistles contains seven component
            parts, viz:—(1) the address to the individual church, i. e. to
            the angel of the church who represents the church itself; (2) the
            command of Christ to the seer to write; (3) the title of Christ,
            usually taken from the vision of the glorified Redeemer in the
            opening chapter; (4) the praise or blame for good or ill, given
            to the church for the conduct of the past; (5) the divine charge
            or warning against special forms of sin; (6) the promise of
            blessing to the victors; and (7) the call to each individual
            Christian to hear and heed. The order in which the churches are
            addressed is that of a geographical circuit beginning at Ephesus,
            the first city of Asia, and going northward, which seems also to
            have been the order of their importance from the chief city
            downward. The literary form of this section may be regarded as a
            reflection or echo of the manner of the opening <span class=

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The epistle
              to the church in Ephesus is Christ's message to a <span class=
              "tei tei-hi"><span style=
              "font-style: italic">declining</span></span> church, a church
              which had left its first love:—<span class=
              "tei tei-q">“Remember ... and repent”</span>. In this epistle
              Christ is <span class="tei tei-q">“he that walketh in the midst
              of the seven golden candlesticks”</span>, and <span class=
              "tei tei-q">“he that holdeth the seven stars in his right
              hand”</span>, i. e. he who is continually present among the
              churches, and who upholds them by his power. The candlesticks
              are objective representations of the seven churches bearing
              light upon the earth, as in the prophecy of Zechariah (ch.
              4:1-10) a seven-branched candlestick stands for the Jewish
              nation as the representative of the kingdom of God; while the
              seven stars, the counterpart of the candlesticks, represent the
              churches held in the hand of Christ shining in heaven. In this
              symbolism it will be seen that the stars represent the churches
              in their relation to Christ, while the candlesticks are
              intended to exhibit their relation to the world. To move the
              <span class="tei tei-q">“candlestick out of its place”</span>
              is a threatening of extinction to the particular church unless
              it repent. Those <span class="tei tei-q">“who call themselves
              apostles and they are not”</span>, were probably well known
              pretenders of the closing part of the first century. The
              Nicolaitans here condemned, were an early obscure sect
              concerning which little is known, but who are reputed to have
              been libertines and seem to have denied the obligation of the
              moral law. The epistle is declared to contain, as we find the
              other epistles are also, <span class="tei tei-q">“what the
              Spirit saith to the churches”</span>, a clear indication of a
              wider message than to the individual community of the separate
              church.<a id="noteref_333" name="noteref_333" href=

              <span class="tei tei-q">“To eat of the tree of life”</span> as
              the reward of overcoming, is a reference to the story of Eden
              (Gen. 3:22), and then by anticipation to the joys of the New
              Jerusalem which are the inheritance of the redeemed soul (cf.
              ch. 22:2; and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
              "font-style: italic">Bk. of Enoch</span></span>, 25:4-5).
              Paradise, a word rarely used in the New Testament and probably
              of Persian origin, is here employed to describe the future
              abiding place of the redeemed.<a id="noteref_334" name=

              of the seven churches to whom John was instructed to write,
              though it has long since ceased to exist. The city of Ephesus,
              which was some sixty miles northeast of Patmos and was then a
              large and wealthy metropolis, has experienced more vicissitudes
              in its history than any other city of the Roman province of
              Asia. At that time it ranked first among all the cities of the
              province, and shortly after it became the capital; but it
              subsequently fell into decay, and it is now only a squalid heap
              of ruins.</p>

              (2) The Epistle to the Church in Smyrna, Ch. 2:8-11</h4>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The epistle
              to the church in Smyrna is Christ's message to a <span class=
              "tei tei-hi"><span style=
              "font-style: italic">suffering</span></span> church, a church
              which had endured tribulation, poverty, and the blasphemy of
              the Jews:—<span class="tei tei-q">“Fear not.... Be thou
              faithful”</span>. Christ is here described as <span class=
              "tei tei-q">“the first and the last, who was dead and lived
              again”</span>, a thought of special consolation for those who
              were about to be cast into prison in the coming persecution,
              and many of whom would suffer death—like Christ they would live
              again. There is, also, a possible allusion in this to the
              popular myth concerning the death and resurrection of
              Dionysius, the favorite deity of Smyrna,<a id="noteref_335"
              name="noteref_335" href="#note_335"><span class=

              with which the death and resurrection of Christ, the notable
              facts of the gospel, are placed in marked contrast. The
              recognized poverty of the church in such a rich city is
              remarkable, and it has been suggested that it may have been
              partly at least the result of pillage by a mob;<a id=
              "noteref_336" name="noteref_336" href="#note_336"><span class=

              "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">336</span></span></a>
              though more likely the feeling against the gospel in the midst
              of wealth like that of Smyrna was so strong as to make its
              message unacceptable to any but the very poor. It will be seen
              that the church receives no blame in this epistle, but only
              counsel and encouragement. The ten days of tribulation
              represent a period that is short but complete in itself, i. e.
              it has a fixed limit, for ten is the number of completeness.
              The crown of life promised to the victors is not the royal
              diadem but the victor's crown, which is the symbol of life
              eternal, and is the antithesis of the second death, i. e. of
              the soul in hell (cf. ch. 20:14; and 21:8). John may have here
              had in mind the crown often laid upon the head of the dead body
              of an earthly victor in his funeral procession—a crown of death
              with which the crown of life is placed in apposition. The
              second death by which <span class="tei tei-q">“he <span class=
              "tei tei-pb" id="page104">[pg 104]</span><a name="Pg104" id=

              be hurt”</span>, is the death of the soul—not ceasing to be,
              but dying to the best in life—the final condemnation which
              sinners undergo at the judgment. Smyrna is located some forty
              miles north, and somewhat west, of Ephesus, and was one of the
              most wealthy, important, and beautiful cities of Asia Minor. It
              has an unbroken record from the dawn of history to the present
              day, and now has a population of some two hundred and fifty
              thousand, and is both rich and prosperous.</p>

              name lies in the similarity of Balaam's method of seducing the
              Israelites by licentiousness, and that of the false teachers
              who were introducing Antinomianism (cf. Num. 25:1-2; and
              31:16). The hidden manna represents the true bread of life, and
              is doubtless an allusion to the pot of manna laid up before the
              Lord in the hidden recesses of the holy place in the tabernacle
              (Ex. 16:33f.). There may also be a reference to the Jewish
              tradition that Jeremiah <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
              "page105">[pg 105]</span><a name="Pg105" id="Pg105" class=
              "tei tei-anchor"></a> had hidden the ark with its contents in a
              cave of Sinai until the advent of the Messiah (<span class=
              "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">II
              Macc.</span></span> 2.1), when it was be restored. The white
              stone is probably the jade, which has been held in high esteem
              in the East from the earliest times,<a id="noteref_340" name=
              "noteref_340" href="#note_340"><span class=
              "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
              "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">340</span></span></a>
              although some think it refers to the diamond. White stands as
              the emblem of purity, but the exact symbolism of the stone in
              this connection is obscure, though clear enough to the first
              readers of the epistle. The figure may possibly have been drawn
              from the Jewish sacred use of precious stones, especially of
              the mysterious Urim and Thummim kept in the pouch of the
              breastplate of the high priest, which according to Jewish
              tradition were inscribed with a name known only to the priest
              himself.<a id="noteref_341" name="noteref_341" href=
              "#note_341"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
              "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">341</span></span></a>
              The gift would then imply the conferring of high-priestly
              privileges on those who overcome. Some, however, find in it a
              reference to the white pebble of acquittal used in courts of
              justice, or in casting the lot; others a reference to the
              <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
              "font-style: italic">tessera</span></span>, or ticket, which
              admitted the victor in the Olympic games to the public tables,
              and entitled him to the awards of his city; still others a
              reference to the common use of amulets and charms with a secret
              name or pass-word on them, in that case the white stone
              conferring the real power which the charm was assumed to
              have.<a id="noteref_342" name="noteref_342" href=
              "#note_342"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
              "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">342</span></span></a>
              But more probably the reference is to a stone engraved as a
              seal, with the name of Christ upon it, the gift of which like
              the signet of a king (Gen. 41:42 and Est. 8:2f.) is regarded as
              bestowing something of the royal authority of Christ upon the
              recipient. Precious stones of different shapes were commonly
              used for seals, and were often unmounted and hung by a cord
              about the neck; and the name of the owner and of the deity whom
              he specially worshipped were engraved upon them.<a id=
              "noteref_343" name="noteref_343" href="#note_343"><span class=

              "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">343</span></span></a>
              Every man of rank and wealth in the East from time immemorial
              <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page106">[pg 106]</span><a name=
              "Pg106" id="Pg106" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> had his own
              seal; and among the Babylonians so constant and imperative were
              its uses that it was generally placed with his body in his
              coffin.<a id="noteref_344" name="noteref_344" href=
              "#note_344"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
              "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">344</span></span></a>
              In all these interpretations the gift carries with it special
              privilege or advantage, though the chief virtue of the stone
              apparently lies in the name written upon it. The <span class=
              "tei tei-q">“new name”</span> is not probably a new designation
              for the believer, but the new name of Christ (ch. 3:12) which
              is expressive of the new and more perfect revelation of him in
              heaven that only the redeemed can know (ch. 14:1). Many,
              however, regard the new name as the heavenly name of the
              individual Christian,<a id="noteref_345" name="noteref_345"
              href="#note_345"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
              "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">345</span></span></a>
              and this would be quite as appropriate for a seal as the name
              of Christ. Pergamus was about a hundred miles north of Ephesus,
              and less than fifteen from the sea. It was at that time the
              official capital of the Province of Asia, and the seat of
              official authority. It ranked with Ephesus and Smyrna as one of
              the great cities of proconsular Asia, and though it is now
              chiefly <span class="tei tei-q">“a city of magnificent
              ruins”</span>, it still continues to exist under the name of
              Bergama at the present day.</p>

              patience:—<span class="tei tei-q">“Hold fast till I
              come”</span>. Christ is called <span class="tei tei-q">“the Son

              are like unto burnished [or molten] brass”</span>, i. e. he who
              is divine, and whose all-searching sight and destroying
              footstep will surely recompense the evil (cf. Dan. 10:6). It is
              interesting to note that the title <span class="tei tei-q">“Son
              of God”</span> which is here used is not found elsewhere in the
              book, though the divine personality of Christ is so evident
              throughout. Jezebel, the self-styled prophetess that the church
              had tolerated, but who with her children is about to be
              punished with death, is probably the symbolic name of a class

              is such a revelation of Christ himself (ch. 22:16b) made to the
              redeemed when the night of earth is over as will usher in the
              morning of eternal day—the beginning of the future and ever
              progressive revelation of God. The titles applied to Christ in
              this epistle, <span class="tei tei-q">“Son of God”</span>, and
              <span class="tei tei-q">“morning star”</span>, have suggested a
              possible contrast in thought with Apollo, the sun-god
              worshipped at Thyatira, though such an allusion is quite
              uncertain. The epistle to this church is the central one of the
              seven, and is the longest as well as in some respects the most
              solemn of all the epistles. Thyatira lay about forty miles
              southeast from Pergamus, and was an important and wealthy city
              in the northern part of Lydia, though it never became a leading
              city of Asia. The modern name of the town is Ak-Hissar,

              fate from which those who overcome are declared to be exempt,
              is to cease to have any part in the life eternal—a figure drawn

              distinction is thereby intended between the churches, dividing
              them into two groups, the first consisting of three and the

              and it must be said that for most minds it does not exist. The
              church in Philadelphia, among the last four, is a steadfast
              church, while the church at Pergamus, among the first three, is
              an impure church in the view of many careful interpreters; and
              Ephesus has evidently gone back, while Thyatira has gone
              forward. The city of Sardis, to which this letter was
              addressed, lay about thirty miles south-east of Thyatira, and

              Those <span class="tei tei-q">“that say they are Jews and they
              are not”</span>, are men untrue to their Judaism in rejecting
              the promised Messiah; for to John's mind it was evident that
              only such Jews as believe in Jesus could belong to the real
              people of God. <span class="tei tei-q">“The hour of

              trial), <span class="tei tei-q">“that hour which is to come
              upon the whole world”</span>, seems to be here equivalent to
              <span class="tei tei-q">“the great tribulation”</span> spoken
              of by our Lord (Matt. 24:21), and serves to introduce that
              element of shadow which ever hung in the background of
              Apocalyptic perspective. But the crisis at hand is not
              necessarily the end; the general tenor of the Revelation would
              rather show that it is only one of many crises that constantly
              progress toward the end.<a id="noteref_358" name="noteref_358"

              so much for support as for glory and for beauty, like the

              perhaps with the additional idea of permanence and strength

              name of God, of the city of God, and of the Son of God,
              Christ's own new name known only to himself, are to be written

              use of three names. Philadelphia, which lay about twenty-eight
              miles southeast from Sardis, receives unmixed praise, and the
              city remains almost unchanged unto this day, though it has been
              transformed into the Mohammedan town of Ala-Sheker,
              <span class="tei tei-q">“the reddish city”</span>, a name
              derived from the speckled, red brown hills around. It is
              renowned as having had the most glorious history of all the

              God created, for Christ is not a creature, but rather he is the

              "Pg111" id="Pg111" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> forever. The
              church is openly rebuked for a tepid Christianity that is
              nauseous to Christ, a religion that is <span class=
              "tei tei-q">“neither cold nor hot”</span>. Laodicea was a city
              of trade and enterprise, but John regarded the church as
              <span class="tei tei-q">“devoid of initiative”</span> in
              Christian work. The phrase <span class="tei tei-q">“thou sayest
              I am rich ... and have need of nothing”</span>, perhaps
              reflects the boast of the city which, proud of its wealth, had
              lately refused help from the liberality of the Emperor after
              being destroyed by an earthquake (A. D. 60); and the
              exhortation <span class="tei tei-q">“I counsel thee to buy of
              me gold”</span>, is perhaps a reference to the heavenly riches
              as far surpassing the earthly which the people of the city
              possessed. The <span class="tei tei-q">“white garments”</span>,
              the type of a pure life, may be here intended to be put in
              contrast with those produced from the glossy black wool of the
              sheep for which the place was noted; and the <span class=
              "tei tei-q">“eye-salve”</span> to be contrasted with the noted
              eye-powder of the neighboring temple of Asklepios, as the

              Laodicea during the Roman period attained great prosperity, and
              was the meeting place of the Council of Laodicea in A. D. 361,
              but has long since been ruined and deserted. It lay some sixty
              miles southeast of Philadelphia, and east of Ephesus, in the
              valley of the Lycus, and was the leading bishopric of Phrygia
              throughout the Christian period.<a id="noteref_364" name=

              In this closing epistle of the seven the climax of promise is
              reached in the assurance that <span class="tei tei-q">“he that
              overcometh”</span> shall sit with Christ in his Messiah throne
              (v. 21), i. e. shall share with him in the glory and rule of
              the church triumphant. This promise seems to take a forward
              glance to the vision of the next two chapters, especially to
              the view of the Lamb in the midst of the throne. A preparation
              is thus made for the sudden transition from the introduction
              and epistles to the chief visions of the book, after the
              closing words of this epistle have been written. <span class=
              "tei tei-q">“He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit

              and warning to the church in Laodicea, to each of the seven
              churches in Asia, and then through them to the whole church
              throughout the world in all time, exhorting them to hear and
              obey the message given in each and all of the seven
              epistles.</p>

          4:1-22:5</span></h2>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Revelation
          Proper, which occupies the chief portion of the book, is a symbolic
          view of the great spiritual conflict of the ages, reviewing the
          whole course and outcome of the far-reaching struggle between the
          church and the world, with the multiple and diverse forces that are
          engaged in it, and setting forth the absolute decisiveness of the
          final issue. It consists of a series of seven visions which
          undertake to solve the apparent anomalies of God's present rule
          among men by affording recurrent glimpses of the working out of a
          great, comprehensive, underlying plan,—a providential and moral
          order in the world that is divine and sovereign, interpenetrated
          with a concurrent redemptive purpose that is gracious and
          elective,—which leads on through progressive stages of trial and
          warfare, of threatening and judgment, to the complete and final
          overthrow and punishment of all the wicked and to the full and
          glorious vindication and triumph of all the holy. The seven
          visions, when carefully examined, will be seen to be progressive in
          their revelation; for while they do not follow any line of temporal
          succession, they yet show a progress of thought and movement
          throughout. Beginning with the vision of God on the throne, a
          vision of sovereignty, they advance in manifest order through the
          vision of the seven seals, a vision of trial, and the vision of the
          seven trumpets, a vision of threatening, to the vision of conflict,
          a vision of warfare, which is central to all and furnishes a key to
          the general interpretation of the book. Then by a scale of
          descending climax they pass on to the vision of the seven vials, a
          vision of judgment, followed by the vision of victory, a vision of
          vindication, and this again by the vision of the New Jerusalem, a
          vision of triumph, which reveals the final goal of Christian hope
          in the immediate presence of God.<a id="noteref_365" name=
          "noteref_365" href="#note_365"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">365</span></span></a> The
          purpose of the Apocalypse is thus disclosed to be interpretative of
          God's plan of the ages, an unfolding of the drama of destiny, in
          which, notwithstanding all apparent contradictions and present
          reverses, he is yet ever leading on to full and final victory in
          the end—through all the conflict he is winning, even against
          appearances, and will triumph at last,—a view full of encouragement
          for tried and disheartened Christians of the first and each
          succeeding century. Why God permitted <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page113">[pg 113]</span><a name="Pg113" id="Pg113" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> this struggle to be begun and then let it
          continue throughout the centuries, why he ever allowed sin to find
          a place among his moral creatures, is a topic nowhere entered upon
          or discussed throughout the book. It is evidently recognized as
          belonging to the unrevealed mysteries of God which lie outside the
          sphere of the present Revelation. But that he overrules all the
          apparently inapt and sinful conditions of this world for the
          ultimate good of his kingdom, and that he will victoriously triumph
          at last, is the assuring witness of the whole series of visions.
          The Apocalyptic form, we find, becomes more marked and definite in
          this main portion of the book, and the difficulties of
          interpretation are correspondingly increased; for they are no
          longer chiefly those of grammatical exegesis and historical
          allusion, but rather the elucidation of a body of mysterious
          symbols. The purpose and limits of the present volume forbid the
          discussion of many of the exegetical difficulties, and serve to
          confine attention mainly to the meaning of the symbolism as the
          chief subject concerning which there is wide difference of opinion.
          Questions of grammatical, or grammatico-historical, exegesis will
          be found more fully considered in the various commentaries to which
          the reader is referred in the footnotes. The visions and episodes
          into which the main part of the book is properly divisible, are
          given separately in the following analysis, i. e. the seven seals,
          trumpets, and vials are each considered in order consecutively, and
          the episodes which intervene are taken up after each sevenfold
          vision is complete, in order that they may be better understood.
          This preserves the connection of the seven in the series, and
          emphasizes by itself the lesson of the episodes which are
          interjected into the natural order.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The opening
            vision of the seven chief visions in the Revelation is a
            Theophany, revealing the majesty of the divine glory and the
            might of the sovereign rule of God as the abiding source of the
            church's confidence in the midst of trial and distress, and as
            the unfailing ground of faith in the fulfilment of the revelation
            that follows. This vision of the fifth and sixth chapters is
            preparatory to those that deal with the present and future
            prospects of the church upon earth, and with this in view it sets
            forth <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page114">[pg
            114]</span><a name="Pg114" id="Pg114" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            the causal and higher relations upon which the history of the
            church depends, viz. God's sovereignty in creation and in
            redemption; for it is only in relation to these two great abiding
            facts of the divine activity that the passing events of time have
            their true meaning. We look first upon the stability of the
            eternal throne, and upon the person of the divine atoning Lamb,
            and then we are better prepared to understand the drama of
            history, and to view with equanimity the dread scenes of crisis
            and conflict which belong to the lot of the church upon earth.
            The scene described in the fourth and fifth chapters, of the
            eternal throne with those who are attendant upon it, and of the
            Lamb in the midst of it, constitutes a proem to the succeeding
            visions, and may be thought of as continuing throughout and
            forming the background for all that follows, in the light of
            which it must be viewed and its meaning interpreted. In the fifth
            chapter the action proper to the Revelation begins with the
            taking of the sealed book, though some regard the action as
            beginning with the sixth chapter in the opening of the seals. The
            present vision is introduced with the phrase <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“after these things”</span> (v. 1), which does not
            indicate an interval of time but rather a succession of events,
            and always marks a break in the connection and a new phase of the
            revelation.</p>

              eternal verities are to be revealed, but that earthly things
              are to be seen from the heavenly point of view. And we are told
              that straightway John <span class="tei tei-q">“was in the

              voices, the tokens of divine power, majesty, and judgment. The
              divine Person is presented as enthroned, but is not named, and
              is described only by comparison, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

              with religion as it is true to art. His appearance is glorious
              like jasper and sardius, the last and first of the precious
              stones on the breastplate of the highpriest, and part of the
              foundation stones of the heavenly city.<a id="noteref_366"

              The pure jasper and the red sardius are the apparent symbols of
              purity and justice (cf. Ezek. 1:26, and 10:1; Dan. 7:9;
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bk of
              Enoch</span></span> 14:18f.). Before the throne, we are told,
              there is <span class="tei tei-q">“as it were, a sea of
              glass<a id="noteref_367" name="noteref_367" href=
              "#note_367"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

              like unto crystal”</span>, the symbol of the calm and fulness
              of life in God's completed kingdom in contrast with the stormy
              sea of earthly nations, the calm of the heavenly life in
              antithesis with the turmoil of the earthly. This seems to be
              the more natural interpretation of the passage, yet the
              symbolism of the sea in the Revelation has been interpreted
              with a good deal of freedom, and there is wide difference of
              opinion concerning its meaning. It is regarded by many as the
              symbol of purification the antitype of the laver before the
              tabernacle, while others find in it a type of the eternal
              fulness of joy in the presence of God. Some think the sea is
              placed before the throne as a symbol of the former trial and
              conflict of the earthly life through which the saints have
              passed to reach the presence of God, and that it has now become
              a perpetual memorial of victory, for the sea is glassy and
              quiet as the sign that the conflict is over.<a id="noteref_368"
              name="noteref_368" href="#note_368"><span class=
              "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
              "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">368</span></span></a>
              Other late writers connect the sea with early Hebrew ideas of
              the waters before the firmament (Gen. 1:7), traces of which
              continue to appear in Apocalyptic literature, and hold that
              this conception underlies the symbolism of the molten sea in
              Solomon's temple and forms the basis of the present
              description.<a id="noteref_369" name="noteref_369" href=
              "#note_369"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
              "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">369</span></span></a>
              With figures so flexible as these it is quite possible that
              different thoughts have been included, for the sea was closely
              interwoven with the early stage of Israel's history, and may
              have become a symbol covering a wide range of correlative
              ideas. But however we may interpret the meaning of the
              symbolism, the presence of the sea in the vision undoubtedly
              serves to enhance the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page116">[pg

              may have been introduced partly for that purpose, though the
              sea undoubtedly had a permanent place in Hebrew thought.</p>

              apprehension. The elders (Gr. <span class=

              of the redeemed church,<a id="noteref_370" name="noteref_370"

              throne wearing golden crowns and sitting on lesser thrones
              reigning with Christ, the fitting tokens of royal dignity and
              authority, and of their triumphant victory through him who is
              their Saviour. They are ever active in service, casting their
              crowns before the throne and him that sitteth thereon as they
              worship, and joining in every chorus of adoration.<a id=

              Their number is that of the twelve patriarchs and apostles
              combined, indicating that they represent the church of both
              dispensations, the saints of the Old and New Testaments. They
              are not, however, the twelve patriarchs and apostles themselves
              enthroned, as suggested by some, but ideal beings who have a
              representative character. Their number, twice twelve, i. e.
              twice the national number of Israel, aptly symbolizes the
              glorified church of all the ages.<a id="noteref_372" name=

              Some find in these elders a group of angelic beings who are
              attendants of the divine glory and whose presence in the
              heavenly temple was a part of ancient Jewish tradition, as in
              the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
              "font-style: italic">Judgment of Peter</span></span>, where it
              is said, <span class="tei tei-q">“For there are four and twenty
              elders, twelve upon the right hand and twelve upon the
              left.”</span><a id="noteref_373" name="noteref_373" href=

              There is no reason to infer, however, that the Greek term
              <span class="tei tei-q">“presbyters”</span>, or <span class=
              "tei tei-q">“elders”</span>, with its definite meaning in the
              New Testament church, is otherwise used in the Apocalypse, even
              though the elders are here the representatives of a class. It
              is quite possible that the earlier use of the four and twenty
              elders in Apocalyptic literature may have been the occasion of
              their introduction here, but there was nothing in the usage of
              the past to prevent its modified application in a Christian
              sense so natural as this in the first century; on the contrary
              it is quite in accord with the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

              Apocalyptic thought that they should be introduced here to
              represent the church enlarged by New Testament accessions. It
              is certainly quite beside the mark to affirm that this idea of
              the church as a combination of the Old and New Testament saints
              is <span class="tei tei-q">“medieval”</span>;<a id=

              The Seven Lamps of Fire (or Torches), Ch. 4:5b</h4>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These lamps
              are seen burning before the throne which they serve to
              illumine, recalling the seven-branched candlestick in the
              tabernacle, and they are seven in number, doubtless, to
              indicate their fulness or completeness. We are told that the
              lamps <span class="tei tei-q">“are [i. e. are the symbol of]
              the seven Spirits of God”</span>; they are, therefore,
              evidently designed to represent the Holy Spirit throughout the
              Revelation, the seven Spirits that are before the throne (ch.
              1:4) and that serve to denote the fulness of the Spirit's
              operation, his manifold energy in contradistinction to the
              unity of his person. The fitness of fire, or a flaming torch,
              to symbolize the illuminative influence of the Spirit is quite
              evident, throwing light upon the throne and revealing God to
              men, but the use of seven torches, like that of seven Spirits,
              is peculiar to the Revelation, and is introduced, one is
              constrained to think, for a special purpose. That the Holy
              Spirit is indicated by this symbol throughout is shown by the
              context (cf. chs. 1:4 and 3:1), but it is evidently used here
              to set forth the Spirit from a particular point of view, i. e.
              to represent in a concrete form the divine perfection of the
              Spirit as displayed in his multiple activities. It seems to be
              an echo from the vision of Zechariah (ch. 3:9, and 4:10) where
              the divine pervasive insight is represented by the <span class=

              These are composite creature-forms that are manifestly to be
              identified with the cherubim of the Old Testament. Each
              creature consists of four representative forms of animal life
              combined in one, viz. that of the lion, the ox, the eagle, and
              man, together producing a strange, anomalous figure which is
              generally thought to personify wild animals, domestic animals,
              birds, and man, as possessing a common physical life, or
              created life in its entirety represented by its higher and more
              notable forms. In the Revelation each has a different face,
              according to the animal form which is made prominent, and not
              four faces as in Ezekiel (Ezek. 1:5-14), the individual life
              being thereby made more manifest. These living ones are ideal
              symbols of the physical creation, especially of all created
              life, and represent in the vision the entire earthly creation
              as sharing in the benefits of redemption,<a id="noteref_376"

              manifesting the divine glory, and waiting upon God. They are
              used in the Old Testament as impressive symbols of the divine
              presence, and Jehovah is known as <span class="tei tei-q">“he

              reflection of the thought embodied in the arrangement of the
              ark of the covenant, where the mercy seat with the shekinah
              flame was placed between the cherubim. In John's vision the
              living creatures are seen in closest proximity to the throne,
              and they lead the heavenly choir in an unceasing song of praise
              (the Creation Chorus, v. 8-11), the closing verse of the song
              indicating their function in the heavenly court to glorify God,
              as also the part they subsequently have in the song of the
              redeemed (the Redemption Chorus, ch. 5:13) reflects the nature
              of their worship. They are full of eyes, the sign of their
              all-seeing watchfulness; they have three pairs of wings, the
              symbol of their spiritual ministry, for three is the sign of
              the spiritual as the wings are of activity; and they are four
              in number while each is fourfold to indicate their relation to
              the organic world, for four is always the earth number. Also,
              they rest not day and night, showing the characteristic of life
              in its fullest energy and ceaseless activity, <span class=
              "tei tei-pb" id="page119">[pg 119]</span><a name="Pg119" id=

              "tei tei-q">“holy”</span> thrice repeated,—three a symbol of
              the divine,—corresponding to the Trisagion of Isaiah's prophecy
              (ch. 6:3), declaring the holiness of God, the All-Ruler, as
              especially revealed in creation, all created beings ministering
              to the manifestation of the divine glory. The identity of the
              living creatures with the cherubim of the Old Testament is
              generally recognized, but the origin of the idea of the
              cherubim in connection with the worship of Jehovah is as
              obscure as the actual form is indefinite, though probably
              derived from a primitive stage of religious thought among the
              Semitic people, and early incorporated as a symbol in the
              religion of Israel. Apparently the form and conception varied
              somewhat through time, as will be seen by comparing Ezekiel's
              description with that which is given here, though the general
              idea remained the same. Some think the cherubim to have been
              originally the storm-clouds personified, regarded as supporting
              the divine throne and surrounding the divine Person, while the
              seraphim represented the lightning-flash revealing God to men.
              Others regard them as unidentified nature-forces idealized in
              forms of life, and traditionally associated with the throne of
              God. But whatever their origin, their meaning in Scripture is
              plain, viz. the physical creation waiting upon God.<a id=

              divine purpose through him to throw light upon the plan of God
              for the ages. A sealed book or scroll, the sign that its
              contents are hidden, and written within and without, i. e. upon
              both sides, or within and also on the back,—filled to its very
              margins like the roll in Ezekiel (ch. 2:9-10),—indicating the
              exceeding fulness of its contents and the completeness of the
              divine plan, is seen lying <span class="tei tei-q">“in [or
              upon] the right hand of him that sat on the throne”</span>.
              This book, which at first no one can be found to <span class=

              "Pg120" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> open, apparently contains
              God's multitudinous and unrevealed purposes concerning the
              future course of the church in the world,—as is afterward more
              fully indicated by the nature of the things portrayed when the
              seals are broken,—for it evidently pertains to the mysteries of
              the kingdom of God on earth, part of which are about to be
              disclosed to John.<a id="noteref_379" name="noteref_379" href=

              The book is closed by seven seals, a perfect number, the symbol
              implying that it is perfectly sealed or fully closed,<a id=

              "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">380</span></span></a> a
              roll apparently sealed in sections, perhaps with the end of the
              parchment fastened down by the seals to its staff so that it
              cannot be opened except by one having authority to break the
              seals.<a id="noteref_381" name="noteref_381" href=

              The book itself, it should be noted, is never read at any
              period of the vision, showing that what it contains is not
              fully disclosed, but as the seals are broken the general nature
              of the contents of each section is symbolically portrayed in
              the form set forth in the succeeding vision of the seals.</p>

              The Lamb, Ch. 5:6-8a</h4>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At this
              point in the vision the divine Redeemer, Jesus Christ, appears
              in order to open the seals, portrayed as the Lamb of God, the
              recognized atoner for sin, a symbol of striking power to every
              one familiar with the Old Testament system of sacrifices. The
              importance of opening the seals had been already indicated in
              the vision (ch. 5:2f.) by the appearance of a strong or mighty
              angel, the sign of high rank and great power, proclaiming with
              a great voice, <span class="tei tei-q">“Who is worthy to open
              the book and to loose the seals thereof?”</span> And when no
              one was found <span class="tei tei-q">“in the heaven, or on the
              earth, or under the earth”</span>, i. e. in the place of the
              spirits of the dead—a phrase equivalent to saying that no one
              could be found in all the universe—the prophet wept much,
              showing his deep interest and bitter disappointment when his
              expectation seemed <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page121">[pg

              representative of the redeemed church, points out to John him
              who is able to open the book because he <span class=

              He is described by the elder as <span class="tei tei-q">“the
              Lion that is of the tribe of Judah”</span> (Gen. 49:9), and
              <span class="tei tei-q">“the Root of David”</span> (Isa. 11:1),

              and prophetic relations to Israel; but when he appears to
              John's wondering view it is in sacrificial form as the Lamb of
              God,<a id="noteref_384" name="noteref_384" href=
              "#note_384"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

              the sign of his priestly relation to his people, bearing marks
              as though he had been slain, but now standing in living power
              in the midst of the throne, the center of all attention and the
              glorified object of all worship, alike the agent of redemption
              and the consummation of sacrifice. The words <span class=
              "tei tei-q">“in the midst of the throne”</span> may mean in the
              center of the throne and encircled by it, or between the throne
              and those surrounding it. Some regard the throne as a
              semi-circle in the open side of which the Lamb stands, and
              within which are placed two of the living creatures, with the
              other two at the back, while the elders surround the throne,
              and the many angels form the outer circle,<a id="noteref_385"

              view that is helpful to those who wish detail in such matters,
              for the chief thought in the symbolism is sufficiently plain.
              It may also be worth while to note how clearly this symbolism
              implies that the redeemed church, represented by the elders,
              stands nearer to the throne of God than even the angels.<a id=

              The seven horns of the Lamb symbolize the fulness of his power,
              for the horn is the Hebrew emblem of power as seven is of
              fulness or completeness of quality; and his seven eyes
              represent the perfection of his vision and knowledge, seeing
              with the omniscient eyes of the Holy Spirit (Zech. 4:10) who
              proceedeth alike from the Father <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

              He takes the book out of the right hand of God as a token of
              his rightful authority, an act full of meaning, for he alone
              has prevailed and has power to open the book and to reveal
              God's purposes because he has redeemed the church and himself
              directs the path of her history. In this sublime vision of the
              Lamb in the midst of the throne we may be truly said to have
              reached <span class="tei tei-q">“the point of highest dramatic

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The taking
              of the book is followed by an act of profound worship; the four
              living creatures and the four and twenty elders fall down
              before the Lamb, having each one a harp, the instrument of
              praise, and a golden bowl full of incense, representing the
              prayers of the saints, which they offer before God. Then they
              voice their thought in a new song, the song of the redeemed
              (the Redemption Chorus), which is rendered unto him that
              sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb, declaring him
              worthy that hath been slain to take the book and to open the
              seals, and <span class="tei tei-q">“to receive the power, and

              <span class="tei tei-q">“of every tribe, and tongue, and

              the midst of trials, in a spiritual sense which though
              imperfect foreshadows and assures their complete spiritual
              reign in the new world wherein dwelleth righteousness. This
              song is sung by the four living creatures as the
              representatives of the whole creation who unitedly rejoice in
              the work of redemption together with man, and by the four and
              twenty elders who represent <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
              "page123">[pg 123]</span><a name="Pg123" id="Pg123" class=
              "tei tei-anchor"></a> the church of all time, the personal
              subjects of redemption; and it is chorused by an innumerable
              company of angels, God's sinless creation, who are described as
              consisting of <span class="tei tei-q">“ten thousand times ten
              thousand”</span>, i. e. the square of a myriad, a hundred
              millions in number (or, as the words may mean, <span class=
              "tei tei-q">“myriads of myriads”</span> i. e. hundreds of
              millions), and in addition <span class="tei tei-q">“thousand of
              thousands”</span>, i. e. millions more,—a symbolical expression
              for a numberless host; and it is echoed by <span class=
              "tei tei-q">“every created thing which is in the heaven and on
              the earth and under the earth and on the sea”</span>, i. e. it
              is re-echoed from every created being throughout the universe.
              Thus the Chorus of Creation, wonderful as it was, is surpassed
              by the Chorus of Redemption: and the four living creatures who
              represent creation said in full accord, <span class=

              <span class="tei tei-q">“fell down and worshipped”</span> him
              that liveth forever and ever. The opening of the seals then
              follows, and because of its widely different bearing from that
              which precedes, is usually considered as forming a separate
              vision, though the transition is not otherwise marked than by a
              change of action and progress of thought.</p>

            Vision of Trial). Ch. 6:1-17, and 8:1</span></h3>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The vision of
            the seven seals is a prophetic delineation of the trials and
            triumphs of the church of Christ throughout all her history,
            especially from the days of John to the end of the world,
            depicted in the symbols of Apocalyptic. These trials fall upon
            all men in common, and from another point of view are also
            judgments upon the sinful world, but they are regarded here
            chiefly as involving the church in suffering, and as preparing
            the way for the triumph of the kingdom of God, the coming of our
            Lord, and the final consummation of all things. The opening of
            the seals by Christ indicates his purpose of revealing the hidden
            contents of the book which he had taken from the right hand of
            God (ch. 5:7), and the number of the seals (seven) shows the
            completeness of the series. The order of the seals is
            progressive, but they have no definite or categorical
            time-relation; they regard only the ceaseless swing of the ages
            ever sweeping on toward the final consummation. The underlying
            divine purpose of testing men by moral struggle is apparent
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page124">[pg 124]</span><a name=
            "Pg124" id="Pg124" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> throughout; the
            trials set forth are disciplinary to those who believe, but
            punitive to those who resist. The form of trials in the vision is
            that of an illustrative symbolism which should not be limited in
            interpretation to the few particular kinds of trouble that are
            described, but should be taken as representative of the whole
            round of sorrows endured by God's people throughout all time, a
            prophetic forecast which, though receiving an immediate
            fulfilment in the experience of the early church, has yet had and
            will have a further and wider fulfilment throughout the course of
            the ages. The subordinate element of judgment upon the wicked in
            the vision is implied rather than stated, except under the sixth
            seal; nevertheless upon further reflection it may be clearly
            seen, for the advancing conquest of Christ includes the overthrow
            of the wicked, while the sorrows of war, famine, and death fall
            upon them without any consolation like the recompense of the
            righteous, the avenging of the martyrs is foretold as eventually
            to be visited upon them, and amidst the terrors of the final
            judgment they find no availing refuge, but cry to the mountains
            and to the rocks to fall upon them to hide them from the face of
            him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb.
            This bearing of the trials of the seals, revealing judgment upon
            the world, should not be overlooked in our interpretation, though
            we should not lay special stress upon it, for it is not the
            foremost thought in mind.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In entering
            upon the more obscure portions of the book it may be well to
            remind the reader that the interpretation will be much
            simplified, and many of the difficulties will disappear, if we
            regard all the mysterious action in these visions as in the
            broadest sense symbolical, and not requiring detailed
            application. And although an effort may well be made to recover
            what has been called the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“ground-view”</span> of the Apostle, i. e. the
            natural application of the prophecy that lay in the immediate
            horizon of history and belonged to the conditions of his time,
            yet this cannot be regarded as absolutely essential to the
            correct interpretation for us and for all ages. We should not
            forget that we are dealing with what is really a great creative
            poem in prose, containing idealized conceptions of widely
            pervasive principles, and therefore its true interpretation lies
            in facts of universal experience rather than in the special
            circumstances which helped <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page125">[pg 125]</span><a name="Pg125" id="Pg125" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> to give it form in the mind of the writer,
            but beyond which he passed with poetic freedom to grasp the
            larger ideal—for to deny that John had any such ideal in mind is
            to do injustice both to his prophetic and poetic insight. And if
            in our anxiety to reproduce the author's native horizon, we allow
            the basis of historical fact to become the chief matter of
            concern, we are sure to lose in literary insight in the
            interpretation of the book far more than we gain through
            clearness of local perspective. For it is always to be reckoned
            <span class="tei tei-q">“amongst the impediments to the study of
            literature ... that the personality of the author, and the
            circumstances of actual life, are forever being allowed to
            interpose between a creative poem and the mind of the
            reader”</span>,<a id="noteref_389" name="noteref_389" href=

            the constant hindrance of any free following of the author's
            constructive idealization. And it is only by avoiding this
            narrowing influence of realism that we are at all likely to reach

              vision depicting the beginning and trend of the gospel age: the
              symbol of the victory of Christ's cause attained through
              conflict, Christianity triumphing in the earth,—for the
              progress of the life of the church is viewed like that of the
              national life of Israel as marked by constant conflict. The
              assurance of victory is made to precede the revelation of trial
              as a ground of comfort and confidence throughout the succeeding
              seals. We may properly regard the contents of this seal as a
              present view of the onward course of the <span class=
              "tei tei-pb" id="page126">[pg 126]</span><a name="Pg126" id=
              "Pg126" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> church, the details of
              which are to be imagined rather than described, a suggestive
              picture which stamps itself upon the mind, for the figure of
              the crowned and conquering Christ once distinctly seen can
              never be effaced but marks all our after-thought of him. This
              vision was realized in some measure in the splendid growth of
              the church in the first and following centuries, but the full
              realization of its promise lies in the fulness of the ages (ch.
              19:11-21)—Christ is ever moving on through the years to final
              victory.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Many
              historical interpreters find in this rider the symbol of
              conquest, especially of judgment on the Roman Empire by the
              Parthians, indicated by the bow, their usual weapon, and
              premonitory of the end.<a id="noteref_392" name="noteref_392"

              In that case the first seal, like the succeeding ones, would
              indicate a form of trial to the church. Others see in the rider
              the sign of Roman conquest, and in the subsequent seals
              precursors of the destruction of Jerusalem, assuming the
              earlier date of the book. These views, however, fail to
              recognize the close similarity and apparent identity of the
              rider in this vision with the one on the white horse in chapter
              nineteen (v. 11) who is evidently divine;<a id="noteref_393"

              nor do they agree with the above view as to the scope of the
              seals, but limit them to the first century, while in the
              interpretation given in this work they reach forward throughout
              the history of the church to the end of time. We must be duly
              careful, according to the symbolic view, not to limit the
              prophecy to too narrow a scope in its complete fulfilment, and
              especially not to exclude the world-wide and universal
              reference, even though it be regarded as the secondary meaning,
              since to many minds this is the essential and larger thought in
              the vision. For we should not forget that while the visions of
              the Apocalypse, like the voices of prophecy and the parables
              and teachings of our Lord, had their immediate occasion and
              purpose, yet this becomes in turn the ground and instrument of
              a wider and permanent divine message to all mankind, and that
              this is the message which is our chief concern.</p>

              of the second living creature, <span class=

              whom is given a great sword, and power to take peace from the
              earth: the symbol of war, and of consequent trial to the
              church. The blood-red horse with his armed rider betokens the
              carnage of battle, and suggests all the horrors of bloodshed
              with its accompanying train of suffering. It is a prediction
              not of any particular war or wars, but of war in general, as
              the <span class="tei tei-q">“wars and rumors of wars”</span> in

              <span class="tei tei-q">“given unto him”</span> (v. 4), we are
              told, that the rider could accomplish his mission, thereby
              indicating the divine authority, limitation, and restraint. The
              sword is the same as the sacrificial knife, and the term used
              for slaying in the passage is the Greek term for killing the
              sacrificial victim, which may be intended to imply that the
              slaughter of the saints is to be included with others.<a id=

              The contents of this seal were realized to some extent in the
              Jewish war connected with the fall of Jerusalem, and in the
              subsequent wars of the Roman Empire which entailed great
              suffering upon the church as well as upon the world. The form
              of the prophecy, however, does not preclude reference to the
              then past as well as to present and to future events; it points
              to the experience of God's children in every age, to the Jewish
              as well as the Christian church, though doubtless with the
              future specially in view. These sorrows have been repeated
              again and again in the numberless wars of history, and may be
              repeated afresh in the future, for war is a constant trial of
              the church throughout the centuries. The symbol of the armed
              rider on the blood-red horse presents a vivid picture of the
              horrors of war. It was a figure which spoke to the imaginative
              Eastern mind with a power superior to words, especially to
              those who had known in their own experience the destructive
              ravages of war; but the details were left to be supplied by
              individual thought.</p>

              figure of the black horse and his rider with a balance foretold
              in a form that surpassed the power of language to describe, the
              prevailing gloom and distress of famine. Grain is sold by
              weight instead of measure, thereby indicating its scarcity
              (Ezek. 4:16), and the price is from eight to twelve times its
              usual cost, the food of a working man requiring his entire
              wages, and leaving those dependent on him without
              support.<a id="noteref_395" name="noteref_395" href=

              The famine indicated is not, however, any special season of
              want, but recurrent famine as a condition of trial, and is
              limited in its extent, as indicated by preserving the oil and
              the wine which may be regarded as typical articles of food, or
              the best of the things of common life<a id="noteref_396" name=

              famine affecting the poor rather than the rich, the multitude
              rather than the few. The contents of this seal were realized in
              prevailing famines such as that under Claudius, that at the
              siege of Jerusalem, and many other seasons of want which have
              occurred at different times throughout the ages, but especially
              in the ancient world and in the Far East. The emaciation and
              terror produced by hunger and want was a form of suffering too
              well known among the inhabitants of those lands to need any
              further emphasis—it spoke a language of its own to all those
              who had felt its power.</p>

              The Opening of the Fourth Seal, Ch. 6:7, 8</h4>

              of the fourth living creature, <span class=
              "tei tei-q">“Come”</span>, a pale, ashen colored, or green
              horse, and his rider Death appear, with Hades following after,
              i. e. the world of departed spirits accompanying death as his
              after-part to swallow up his victims, both personified, and
              with power given them to kill with the sword and with famine
              and with death in all its forms: the symbol of mortality in the
              church, destroying the forces of the kingdom. The pale green or
              livid horse, the color of a corpse, reflects the ghastliness of
              a dead body bordering on dissolution, and points to the ruin
              wrought by death. Death is here considered as in itself a
              trial, and some of the more terrible <span class="tei tei-pb"
              id="page129">[pg 129]</span><a name="Pg129" id="Pg129" class=
              "tei tei-anchor"></a> and widespread agencies by which it is
              brought about are mentioned in order to make its ravages more
              impressive. Among other forms death by sword and famine are
              included, evils already introduced under the two former seals
              as the occasion of suffering, but here regarded as leading to
              death and constituting a separate trial. The trial of this seal
              is also limited, and affects only one fourth of men, i. e. a
              fractional part, not an actual fourth, the fourth being perhaps
              suggested by the four horsemen. The contents of this seal were
              realized in the fearful mortality of Roman times by means of
              the fourfold scourge of sword, famine, pestilence, and wild
              beasts, the crown of all sorrows to the Jewish mind; but they
              have also been realized in a similar way, though different
              form, through the many dread visitations of death in later
              days.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It will be
              noticed that almost every part of the symbolism in these
              visions has a meaning of its own. The horse in motion seems to
              indicate the swift progress and triumphal march through the
              earth of the things represented in the first four seals, viz.
              of Christianity the conquering religion, and also of war,
              famine, and death, the widespread terrors which are
              impersonated by the riders as treading the path of the
              centuries. The color of the different horses, too, is not
              without significance; white is the sign of victory (white
              horses were not uncommonly ridden by Roman conquerors)<a id=
              "noteref_397" name="noteref_397" href="#note_397"><span class=
              "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
              "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">397</span></span></a>
              and it is also the symbol of purity, while red is the symbol of
              bloodshed, black of want, and pale or ashen green of death,
              each of the latter betokening something of the nature of the
              scourge which they bring to men. The whole content of the seals
              presents a bare outline of various forms of suffering, and is
              intended to typify a multitude of sorrows that are unnamed. It
              should be noted, too, that at the close of the fourth seal a
              division of the seals is apparent into two groups with four and
              three in each. The first four relate to the sphere of the
              natural world, as the number four indicates, and the fact also
              that they are ushered in by the four living creatures who
              represent creation. These seals are chiefly designed to show
              that during the period in which Christ is carrying forward his
              conquest unto <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page130">[pg
              130]</span><a name="Pg130" id="Pg130" class=
              "tei tei-anchor"></a> victory, both trial and suffering in this
              world form part of the divine purpose of discipline for his
              people which cannot be escaped from but should be endured with
              patience and hope. The last three seals relate to the things of
              the spiritual life, of which three is the symbol, and point
              forward to the future and great reward in the world to come
              which is about to be realized by those who are faithful. The
              same division into four and three, pertaining to the natural
              and the spiritual, though with a distinctive application, is
              found in the visions of the trumpets and vials (see <a href=

              opening of the fifth seal a vision of the souls of the martyrs
              appears, viz. of those <span class="tei tei-q">“that had been
              slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they
              held”</span> (cf. ch. 19:10), who are now seen underneath the
              altar (i. e. the equivalent of the great brazen altar of
              sacrifice in the Jewish service, at the foot of which the blood
              of the sacrificial victims was poured) as the sign of their
              having sacrificed their lives for the truth. The altar is in
              the heavenly temple, which to the Jewish mind was the archetype

              for vengeance in the earthly sense; and they receive each a
              white robe, the recognized symbol of purity and victory, and

              throughout the ages. These saints of God have not been
              delivered from death, but they have been delivered through
              death. The limit of this trial is the <span class=
              "tei tei-q">“little time”</span> of the church's further
              conflict, a period looked upon as relatively short in the whole
              course of the centuries, though not in itself necessarily short
              or definitely limited, for the <span class="tei tei-q">“little
              time”</span> is practically the whole period of this and the
              preceding seals. The contents of this seal <span class=
              "tei tei-pb" id="page131">[pg 131]</span><a name="Pg131" id=

              ten persecutions of the early church, especially those under
              Nero, and under Domitian, belonging to the period of the
              Apocalypse; but they have also been realized in every
              subsequent persecution that has followed the planting of the
              gospel in heathen lands. The martyrs belong to all ages and all
              nations, and include every man who has given his life as a
              testimony for the truth; and this seal looks along the whole
              line and comprehends every martyr of every age.</p>

              The Opening of the Sixth Seal, Ch. 6:12-17</h4>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the
              opening of the sixth seal a vision of an earthquake appears, in
              which the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, the whole moon
              as blood, and the stars of heaven fell, while even the heaven
              itself was removed as a scroll when it is rolled up, and every
              mountain and island were moved out of their places, for we are
              told that the day, the great day, of divine wrath is come: the
              symbol of judgment and retribution, especially of the last
              judgment, and of the destruction of the world. The terrors of
              the judgment thus described are sevenfold, affecting the earth,
              the sun, the moon, the stars, the heavens, the mountains, and
              the islands; and seven classes of men are mentioned, who call
              to the rocks and the mountains to fall upon them and to hide
              them from the wrath of the Lamb, viz. the kings of the earth,
              the princes, the chief captains, the rich, the strong, and
              every bondman, and every freeman,—additional signs of
              universality and completeness. The contents of this seal have
              been realized in one way in the crises of history and the fall
              of empires, which we may regard as described here after the
              analogy of Jewish Apocalyptic, under the form of a great
              catastrophe of nature bringing to an end the existing order of
              things—the fortunes of the people of God, though not their
              fate, being conceived of as inseparably interwoven with the
              world of nature; but this is only a temporary and passing
              fulfilment which foreshadows and points to the final day of
              wrath (called in Greek (v. 17), <span class="tei tei-q">“the
              day, the great [day] of their wrath”</span>, i. e. of the wrath
              of God and of the Lamb), or the day of the Lord,<a id=

              "Pg132" id="Pg132" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and the end of
              the world. The End is a constant element in all Apocalyptic
              writings, as it is the recurrent point of interest with John in
              the Apocalypse; and it was undoubtedly due to the influence of
              Jewish Apocalyptic conceptions that an expectation commonly
              prevailed in the primitive church that the End was close at
              hand, and that it would come not through development but
              through crises of judgment.<a id="noteref_401" name=
              "noteref_401" href="#note_401"><span class=

              "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">401</span></span></a>
              The important part which the End has in the Apocalypse may be
              regarded as owing in some degree to the place it must
              necessarily occupy in any exhaustive scheme of the course of
              the world; but it is perhaps more largely due to the peculiar
              view-point of Apocalyptic, which exalted the End out of
              proportion to the present in order to impress more deeply its
              lessons.<a id="noteref_402" name="noteref_402" href=

              visions of the six seals had a particular application and an
              undoubted though partial fulfilment in the first age in which
              they were given; but they have a wider and more perfect
              fulfilment in all subsequent time, and perhaps will have an
              especially complete fulfilment in the last time, such as we
              know that the sixth seal will surely have. To seek constantly,
              however, for a merely literal fulfilment is surely to emphasize
              the least important part of their meaning, and to limit them
              narrowly to a definite historical event is to rob them of their
              larger purpose, for they are wide-flung types that speak as

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the
              opening of the seventh seal a vision of heaven wrapped in
              perfect silence appears: the symbol of mystery, the unrevealed,
              the unspoken, the ineffable bliss of heaven which cannot be
              told in human words or portrayed in physical form, the great
              sabbath of the church's history,—a significant sign of the
              deep, unbroken rest <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page133">[pg
              133]</span><a name="Pg133" id="Pg133" class=

              people of God shall enter at the end of the earthly trial, and
              of the fulness of joy to be realized in the future life of the
              redeemed when the conflict and judgment of this world are over,
              all of which now lies beyond the power of words or vision to
              describe or display. The form of the vision is remarkably
              suggestive; the silence indicates that which cannot be spoken;
              it gives time for thought that is beyond expression, deepens
              <span class="tei tei-q">“the sense of trembling
              suspense”</span>, and serves to quicken anticipation of the
              revelation to follow.<a id="noteref_403" name="noteref_403"

              The contents of this seal are to be realized in the future life
              of the redeemed after the conflict and judgment of this world
              are over, and they cannot now be revealed except in symbol;
              they lie beyond the sphere of earthly thought. The half-hour is
              a broken, fractional number, implying a limited period, and is
              here the sign of the relatively brief time during which John
              beheld the vision,—for the period covered by the thought of the
              vision is the whole period of eternity, the future endless life
              with God, and only a glimpse of it is given at this point in
              order to reassure the hearts of God's children in the midst of
              conflict,—thus affording an impressive break between the seals
              and the trumpets, which, though short in itself, must have
              seemed relatively long to the beholder in the midst of such
              stirring scenes. The silence may have been suggested to John's
              mind by that which the people kept during the time when the
              priest offered incense in the temple, for we find that the
              offering of incense by an angel immediately follows (v.
              2-5),<a id="noteref_404" name="noteref_404" href=

              "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">404</span></span></a>
              and the solemnity of that time in John's own experience of the
              ritual worship may well have left its impress upon his mind. In
              closing the series it remains to be said that the last seal,
              notwithstanding that its contents are incompletely developed,
              yet joins with the first, and serves to mark out the whole
              course of the church's history through all the dread and storm
              of the other seals, as ever advancing from opening conquest to
              final peace, all the trials of the seals leading on to deep
              quiet in the end, the symbol of the great and enduring peace of
              God.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page134">[pg

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It may be
              well for us before entering upon the episode of consolation in
              the seventh chapter, to review rapidly the steps by which the
              prime purpose of the Apocalypse has been thus far wrought out
              in the vision of the seven seals, viz. to encourage the hearts
              of weak and suffering Christians and to fortify their patience
              on the upward way in the midst of trial and distress by
              pointing out the path of faith and hope alike to the certainty
              of victory in the future days of the church upon earth, and to
              the fulness of joy reserved for the redeemed in the far and
              fadeless glory beyond. The deeper lesson of the first four
              seals is one of absolute trust in God when the way, as then,
              was dark and the hearts of men terror-stricken. God has not in
              any sense forsaken his people, the vision proclaims, though his
              path and purpose lie hidden in the night. Amid all the trials
              of the earthly life his plan is working out unseen through the
              way to final victory. His people must learn the lesson of
              discipline in the path by which he leads, and strive to trust
              and be patient and obey, while he with unerring wisdom rules
              and works and wins. The closing three seals contain a more
              direct revelation of hope and comfort. Under the fifth seal the
              peace of the future life and the guarantee of recompense to the
              saints is reassured; the vision of the sixth leads to the
              episode of consolation which portrays the safe gathering of the
              redeemed on God's right hand at last, while the contents of the
              seal itself point to the surety and justice of divine judgment
              that shall inevitably fall upon sin and sinners; and the
              seventh reveals the endless and unbroken peace and glory of the
              future life with God. Thus, contrary to all appearances in the
              world of men, the perplexing trials of the Christian life are
              seen in the apocalyptic vision to be not in vain; the painful
              discipleship of Jesus has its abundant reward hereafter; the
              certain and unfailing victory of the righteous lies at the very
              heart of the eternal purpose of God; and this triumphant hope
              is presented as an abiding consolation for the Christian mind
              in the midst of prevailing trial and distress.</p>

            redemption inwrought with judgment, and showing the safety, even
            in the midst of tribulation, of God's people who are divinely
            sealed, as also the certainty of their final reward. It is given
            for the encouragement of tried and suffering Christians who
            cannot understand why they suffer, and as an answer to the
            question in ch. 6:17, <span class="tei tei-q">“who shall be able
            to stand?”</span> i. e. in the midst of such judgment as is
            depicted under the sixth seal. There is, of course, a manifest
            element of consolation for the saints in the contents of the
            seals themselves, as indicated above, viz. the certainty of
            victory under the first, the divine limitation and control
            signified in the second, third, and fourth, the promise of peace
            and reward in the fifth, of vindication and judgment in the
            sixth, and of the heavenly rest in the seventh; but this word of
            comfort receives such a distinct reinforcement and emphasis in
            the episode interposed as to indicate clearly its purpose. The
            blessed consolation for God's people in all ages given in the
            book of Revelation has not, perhaps, been sufficiently emphasized
            in the past,<a id="noteref_405" name="noteref_405" href=

            this has always made it a cherished message for those in
            affliction. The episode is found to consist of two parts,
            corresponding in some degree to the two dispensations, the Old
            and the New, the first setting forth the surety of salvation in
            the divine choice out of Israel (v. 1-8), and the second the
            fulness of salvation in the restoration to the divine presence of
            the entire body of the redeemed out of all nations (v. 9-17), the
            two together manifesting the consoling thought that redemption
            triumphs in the midst of judgment.</p>

                are sealed, i. e. are marked as the subjects of redemption,
                or until his redemptive purpose is complete—the choice
                beginning with Israel. Four, the earth number, is the number
                of the angels, corners, and winds in the vision, indicating
                the world-wide character of the judgment; and the sealing is
                upon earth, though apparently not to be thought of as
                occurring in any particular point of time, and not therefore
                to be placed, as by some, just preceding the final judgment,
                for in a wider sense the sealing stands as a symbol of
                redemption as a whole, viewed in effect as a process
                concurrent with the trials of the seals, and illustrated by
                its operation in Israel.<a id="noteref_407" name=

                The time of holding back the winds is the entire period of
                divine grace, and the sealing shows the brighter side of the
                former picture of trial and suffering—God is ever doing what
                he did in Israel.</p>

                sealing is not revealed; as the act of God it is hidden, and
                only the number of the sealed is given, a hundred and
                forty-four thousand, i. e. the square of twelve, the national
                number, multiplied by a thousand, the cube of ten, the number
                of completeness,—twelve thousand from each tribe, or twelve,
                the number of the tribes of Israel, multiplied by a thousand,
                the number of heavenly completeness: the symbol of a vast,
                complete, but indefinite number chosen from the people of
                Israel and kept unto eternal life as the first-fruits unto
                God and the Lamb, the true or ideal people of Israel, who are
                in a sense representative of all the redeemed. Other
                interpreters, accepting the apocalyptic-traditional view of
                late writers, regard the first section of the episode (v.
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page137">[pg 137]</span><a name=
                "Pg137" id="Pg137" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> 1-8) as a
                reproduction in form or substance from a Jewish apocalypse,
                while the second section (v. 9-17), where there is so
                manifest an expansion of the horizon, is the Christian
                development of the same idea, showing how the older vision
                may be understood in our time.<a id="noteref_408" name=

                Such views evidently have strong attraction for the modern
                mind, but it may well be doubted whether such a view solves
                as many difficulties as it creates, for it assumes the
                existence of documents that have no evidence on which to rest
                except the theory which assumes them.</p>

                opening of the second part of the episode there is a sudden
                expansion of the horizon; every barrier of race and nation
                has disappeared, and a triumphant multitude of the saved from
                all peoples, a company which no man could number, far
                surpassing that of Israel, is seen standing before the throne
                and before the Lamb, arrayed in white robes, the symbol of
                purity,<a id="noteref_410" name="noteref_410" href=
                "#note_410"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

                and having palms in their hands, the token of joy as well as
                victory (cf. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
                "font-style: italic">I Macc.</span></span> 13.51), and
                perhaps, also, as a sign of triumphant homage to the Lamb.
                The use of palms in the Feast of Tabernacles may have been
                foremost in thought here, but we need not confine the
                significance of the figure to the Jewish symbolism of joy. It
                probably includes all the ideas connected with palms that
                were familiar to the thought of the time, without regard to
                their origin; for it is not justifiable to assume that the
                Apocalypse contains no ideas borrowed from heathen antiquity,
                but moves exclusively within the circle of sacred, that is,
                Jewish imagery and symbols.<a id="noteref_411" name=

                "tei tei-anchor"></a> which in the light of later studies in
                Apocalyptic cannot be maintained, though manifestly
                everything has been assimilated by the Jewish conception,
                from whatever source it may have been derived. The phase of
                the vision presented in the ninth verse, affords a view of
                the redeemed church in its fulness, the multitude of the
                saved from both covenants now joined in one body in which no
                distinction of race or nation exists, a view much wider in
                its scope than the former one of the sealing.<a id=

                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Many
                commentators, it must be recognized, view this passage
                differently (v. 4-9), and maintain the full identity of the
                hundred and forty-four thousand and the great multitude by a
                somewhat strained exegesis, making the hundred and forty-four
                thousand the symbol of the Christian church.<a id=

                In the interpretation of such symbols, however, we must
                always allow a latitude of view, for different
                interpretations appeal with varying force to different minds;
                and it should be remembered in holding the view accepted in
                this work, that while the symbol is taken from the case of
                Israel, and is therefore correctly interpreted as applying
                primarily to the people of Israel, yet it is not Jews as
                distinguished from Gentiles that are meant, but the saints of
                the Old Testament as distinguished from those of the New, the
                few in contrast with the many; and that in a wider sense the
                figure symbolizes salvation as a whole, represented here by a
                part in which it is shown to be effective, the main idea
                being salvation made certain and efficient by the divine act
                of sealing, while in the great multitude the symbol is that
                of salvation become world-wide in its results. The question
                of the identity of the two groups is therefore subordinate,
                and cannot be regarded as of any special importance.</p>

                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It may be
                well at this point, in view of the great and radiant
                multitude of the redeemed, the innumerable company out of all
                nations and tribes and peoples and tongues, who stand before
                the throne and join in the cry of <span class=
                "tei tei-q">“Salvation unto our God ... and unto the
                Lamb”</span> (v. 10), for us to emphasize the wide-spread and
                triumphant effect of the gospel in the world of men which is
                here <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page139">[pg

                asserted by modern critics that the outlook of the Revelation
                is narrow and Jewish, and its view limited and discouraging.
                As against this it is well to remember the lesson of these
                verses, as well as that of many other similar passages
                throughout the book (cf. chs. 5:9; 21:24; 22:7, <span class=
                "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">et
                al.</span></span>). We should also clearly see that the
                Revelation from its nature and purpose deals chiefly with the
                plan of God for the ages, and with the causes and events
                which lead on to the end of the world, and that therefore its
                essential message is not addressed to evangelistic effort or
                to missionary enterprise, but to faith in God when days are
                dark and storms fill the sky, and to preparation for meeting
                him in a fairer world when earthly days are done. Yet the
                book just as clearly shows that the divine plan both includes
                and prepares for the essentially world-wide and universal
                mission of Christianity; and the message of the gospel to
                every creature is repeated and emphasized throughout in such
                a way as to make plain that the great work and chief purpose
                of the Kingdom of God in the earth is to redeem and to save
                the lost. And surely this important truth should never be
                left out of view in our perusal of the book.</p>

                ascribed is twofold, in ch. 4:11 it is threefold, in ch. 5:13

                meant a special period of trial such as is implied in ch.
                3:10, and by the words of our Lord in Mat. 24:21, but rather
                the world-tribulation that belongs to the earthly life of the

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The vision of
            the seven trumpets sets forth in pictorial form a divine
            proclamation of the judgments of God upon the sinful world,
            especially those to be experienced throughout the prospective
            history of mankind until the final consummation of all things. It
            consists of another group of seven that are parallel in a certain
            sense to the vision of the seals, covering like them the path of
            the ages, but that form a separate series complete in themselves
            and that are issued for a different purpose, the seals specially
            manifesting God's care of his people in the midst of trial, while
            the trumpets reveal the divine punishment visited upon the
            sinful. These two lines of judgment are conceived of as occurring
            mainly <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page141">[pg
            141]</span><a name="Pg141" id="Pg141" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            in the same period, but looked at from another point of view: or,
            perhaps, it might better be said, that we have here another group
            of seven which follow the whole course of history and develop a
            new line of divinely ordered occurrences that neither follow nor
            precede, but are quite independent of any time-relation to the
            preceding series of the seals. The number of the trumpets, like
            that of the seals, is intended to indicate the completeness of
            the series, for seven is the number of completeness. They are
            general indications of God's judgments, and though particular
            events may be partial fulfilments, the complete fulfilment is in
            all time.<a id="noteref_418" name="noteref_418" href=

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In a short
              intervening section preparatory to the trumpets, we are shown
              that the prayers of the saints lead to the manifestation of
              divine wrath against sin. These verses, it may be said, form a
              transition from the vision of the seals to that of the
              trumpets, and are in fact included by some under the seventh
              seal, though not properly belonging to it. The former vision
              reaches a fitting close in the period of eternal rest which is
              looked upon under the seventh seal, and we wait in the quiet
              that it brings, expecting the end to be announced at once. But
              instead of that a further vision is revealed to the seer, and
              we again traverse the course of history by a different path to
              its ending. In another series of seven under the trumpets the
              punishment of the ungodly is reviewed, and divine wrath is seen
              to fall upon the heads of the sinful. This succeeding series of
              trumpet visions is introduced by verses two to six in the
              eighth chapter.</p>

                1 An Angel Offers Incense upon the Golden Altar, Ch.
                8:3-5</h5>

                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
                incense is added unto the prayers of all the saints which are
                thus typically purified, and they are straightway presented
                before the throne of God in heaven. Incense was the symbol of
                prayer under the Old Testament, but it becomes here, by a
                further development of the symbol, the vehicle for bearing
                the prayers to the throne, and the action apparently follows
                the form of the Jewish ritual worship. An angel standing over
                the brazen altar of sacrifice, takes fire from it in
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page142">[pg 142]</span><a name=
                "Pg142" id="Pg142" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> a golden
                censer or fire-pan, and much incense is then given him to add
                unto the prayers of all the saints, evidently for their
                purification and that he may offer them at the golden altar
                of incense which is before the throne of God. Completing this
                action, the angel returns again to the brazen altar to take
                fire from it that he may cast it as the symbol of judgment
                upon the earth (cf. Ezek. 10:2f). Others, however, think that
                only one altar, that of incense, is referred to in the
                action.<a id="noteref_419" name="noteref_419" href=

                In either case the worship of the Old Testament is the basis
                of the figure, though the scene is laid in heaven.

                seven angels are given seven trumpets with charge of the

                angels who stand before God. Their position implies special
                service, and their number doubtless indicates the perfection

                may be here intended to recall its use at the fall of Jericho
                (Josh. 6:4f). The seven angels may also be taken to represent
                the whole body of angel ministrants who serve before God,

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The sounding
              of the trumpets represents the proclamation of signal and
              destructive judgments upon the ungodly world. The form of these
              judgments in the vision was adapted to current conceptions of
              great calamities, and may be regarded as symbolizing all the
              <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page143">[pg 143]</span><a name=
              "Pg143" id="Pg143" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> terrible woes in
              store for all the wicked in all the ages—wide world-pictures of
              the divine purpose of punishment. The latter half of the first
              century was marked by many terrible visitations, such as
              earthquakes, famines, and plagues, and it should not be thought
              strange to find these events reflected in such a book as the
              Apocalypse at a time when they were fresh in the public mind.
              That they had some such source is evident, for the graphic
              descriptions of appalling disaster by earthquake in Martinique
              (1901), and in Messina (1908), have served to illumine many
              passages in the Revelation, as have also other similar
              occurrences previously known. These judgments in the visions
              constitute not only the divine means of punishment, but become
              the divine test of character, revealing the essential nature of
              evil men; for the effect of the judgments, unlike that of the
              seals, falls mainly upon the evil.</p>

                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
                sounding of the first trumpet is followed by hail and fire
                mingled in blood cast upon the earth: the symbol of disaster
                visited upon the land, and men punished by such means as in
                the days of Pharaoh,—for fire is a symbol of the divine
                presence and wrath, and the blood indicates the destructive
                effects about to be wrought upon both the animate and
                inanimate creation for the chastisement of man. The
                resemblance of the first four judgments of the trumpets and
                also of the vials to the plagues of Egypt, is too manifest to
                escape the attention of any careful reader of Scripture, and
                affords a ready proof of their representative character.
                These well-known historic incidents of judgment, belonging to
                the birth-period of the Hebrew nation, which are so deeply
                inwrought in the Old Testament story, and whose significance
                was so well understood, become the ready types of other
                judgments that are sent with a similar purpose and that
                belong to the divine order, but the intimate nature of which
                it was not the divine purpose to disclose. They are widely
                suggestive of God's power over things the most permanent and
                stable. The destruction of but a third part of the objects
                affected as the result of the trumpet series, represents a
                limited judgment, not an actual third but a fractional
                portion destroyed, a great but not the greater part. The
                earth, the sea, the rivers, and the heavenly bodies, on which
                the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page144">[pg

                "tei tei-anchor"></a> first four judgments fall, are parts of
                a fourfold division of the universe which is common in this
                book, and are intended to designate the entire created world,
                both here and in the vision of the vials.<a id="noteref_422"

                In this comprehensive designation the earth, or the land, was
                thought of as the nourishing mother and the dwelling-place of
                man; the sea as the agent and arena of commerce; the rivers
                as the seat of cities, the centres of population, the
                arteries of trade, and the source of water supply; and the
                heavenly bodies as the source of light, and as the rulers of
                destiny—together representing in common thought the great
                things of life to the world of men. Disaster to these, the
                sources of wealth and well-being, has always been among
                Oriental nations the type of all that is most terrible.</p>

                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
                sounding of the second trumpet is followed by, as it were, a
                great mountain burning with fire cast into the sea, thereby
                working widespread ruin: the symbol of disaster visited upon
                the sea, one part of creation which is used as God's agent
                for punishing mankind. To move a mountain was a token of
                divine power, and it was blazing with fire as a sign of the
                divine presence and wrath—another Sinai in effect flung into
                the sea. This striking figure of a mountain of fire was
                perhaps suggested to John's mind by a volcano, with which he
                must have become familiar while resident in Asia; but
                attention is directed more particularly in these visions,
                especially the first four, to the effect produced rather than
                to the means used, whether hail and fire, or a mountain, or a
                star, or the smiting of the planets.<a id="noteref_423" name=

                The effect produced is one of great terror, though the way in
                which it applies to men is left to be inferred, and is not
                attempted to be described. Such an incident was well adapted
                to the thought of the first century, and could not but strike
                terror in the mind of the beholder because of the complete
                helplessness of men in the presence of such a disaster. It
                presents a wide field for thought, the limits of which are
                not defined. It is in fact one way of saying that God will
                make all nature to strive against man because of sin.</p>

                sounding of the third trumpet is followed by the falling of a
                great star from heaven, called Wormwood, upon the waters,

                still another part of creation, as an act of divine judgment
                upon sinful men who dwell by the waters. As under the former
                trumpets only a third part was affected: <span class=
                "tei tei-q">“And many men died of the waters, because they
                were made bitter.”</span> The falling of a star was regarded
                as a sign of some great disaster about to happen, and is here
                apparently intended to be typical of judgment sent from
                heaven, while the name Wormwood signifies the bitterness of
                the trouble which it entails upon men. But beyond this all is
                indefinite, a quality characteristic of Apocalyptic which
                often heightens rather than lessens the general effect. The
                bitter waters expressed the moral bitterness that men must
                taste because of their sin: the wide result is thus covered
                by an unspoken appeal to thought through a significant
                symbol.</p>

                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
                sounding of the fourth trumpet is followed by the smiting of
                the sun, moon, and stars: the symbol of disaster visited upon
                the heavenly bodies, not only destroying their light but
                inflicting a punishment peculiarly terrifying to the Oriental
                mind because of the occult influence which these bodies were
                supposed to exert upon the future destinies of men. We need
                not necessarily regard John as personally sharing in this
                opinion, but only as using the language and appealing to the
                thought of his time, as in the preceding reference to the
                falling star. He seems to look upon these strange occurrences
                mainly as signs of the divine purpose, as <span class=
                "tei tei-q">“wonders in the heavens and in the earth”</span>
                (Joel 2:30) through which God wrought in manifesting his
                will. The evils resulting from this visitation in the vision,
                as in the former judgments, are suggested rather than named;
                but they lie before the mind in a haunting way to be filled
                in by a vivid imagination with scenes of terror and
                wrath.</p>

                5 The Sounding of the Fifth Trumpet, Ch. 9:1-12</h5>

                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
                sounding of the fifth trumpet is followed by a vision of a
                star from heaven, fallen unto earth, the symbolic
                representation of Satan cast out of heaven for his sin, and
                by smoke as of a great furnace enveloping a swarm of locusts
                that ascend from the pit of the abyss, the present
                dwelling-place of Satan and the familiar haunt of demons: the
                symbol of disaster to men through Satan and his multitudinous
                host, <span class="tei tei-q">“the spiritual hosts of
                wickedness”</span> (Eph. 6:12), the demons from the pit.
                These are permitted to torment men, producing bitter anguish
                for five months, the usual life of the locust, and the symbol
                of an incomplete or limited period of time, which may here
                refer to the time of man's existence upon the earth. Five,
                the half of ten the complete number, is a symbol of
                incompleteness or indefiniteness. The invading army of
                locusts is a well-known figure of widespread disaster, as in
                the prophecy of Joel (ch. 2:1-11). In accordance with general
                apocalyptic usage the pit of the abyss is regarded as the
                present abode of the Devil and his angels, and is conceived
                of as a vast subterranean depth connecting with the surface
                of the earth by a great shaft or well which can be opened or
                closed from above, and the entrance to which may be locked or
                unlocked by a key.<a id="noteref_425" name="noteref_425"
                href="#note_425"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

                That which at first seems to be a cloud of smoke proves to be
                teeming with forms of life, an evident token of the hidden
                nature of the source of evil. The power of the locusts is
                directed immediately against the wicked, such men as have not
                the seal of God on their foreheads, while their sting seems
                to be the type of the poison of sin which they infuse into
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page147">[pg 147]</span><a name=
                "Pg147" id="Pg147" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the veins of
                men, and the torment which they inflict to refer to the
                visitation of sins that bring terrible punishment upon the
                offenders so that men prefer death rather than life. The
                description of the locusts as <span class="tei tei-q">“like
                unto horses prepared for war etc.”</span>, is a realistic
                touch intended to heighten the sense of terror, but not to
                identify them with any objects in human experience. Also the
                statement that <span class="tei tei-q">“their faces were as
                men's faces”</span>, implies only that they were like men in
                appearance, though some think this points to human agents.
                The star is here used in a quite different sense from that
                under the third trumpet,—for to insist that all objects must
                have a single symbolism, and that the star must mean the same
                in every case, i. e. a person, there as well as here, is to
                neglect one of the clearest lessons of Apocalyptic. Here it
                is a personification or symbol of Satan (Isa. 14:12), the
                angel of the abyss, who is named Apollyon,<a id="noteref_426"
                name="noteref_426" href="#note_426"><span class=

                i. e. one who causes perdition to mankind, or in Hebrew,
                Abaddon, i. e. the destroyer, a sufficient identification for
                the reader of the Old Testament. The awful woe that the world
                of evil men suffers at the hands of Satan and his legions is
                the ideal content of this trumpet; and we notice that the
                severity of the judgments seems to increase as they progress
                toward the end. The first woe is now declared to be past (v.
                12), but two others are foretold as yet to come.</p>

                innumerable multitude, which apparently act under direction
                of the four angels, and destroy a third part of men from the

                the symbol of disaster to men through the world-forces of
                heathenism, which are under direction of the world-rulers of
                the darkness (Eph. 6:12). The unbinding of the angels is the
                symbol of evil let loose among men, for the angels are evil
                as is indicated by their being bound, by their number, and by
                the place of their imprisonment, i. e. the binding is the
                symbol of divine restraint until the appointed time; their
                number is four, the earth number, indicating that they belong
                to this world which is usually thought of as evil; and the
                Euphrates, the place where they are bound, is the old seat of
                the world-power, and the representative of heathenism with
                its multitudinous host. The evils inflicted by the heathen
                nations upon mankind, especially the evils of war with their
                concomitant results, are here indicated by this forceful
                figure; yet these, though deep and terrible, entirely fail to
                turn the rest of men, who escape death, from idol worship and
                its attendant impurities—a marvelous forecast of the path of
                history, for the heathen powers have time and again become
                the agents of woe to mankind, yet the people have not
                awakened to the true source of their sorrow in idolatry. The
                description of the horses and of their riders in the vision
                is purely an ideal one, intended to make them the objects of
                greatest terror, a true Oriental touch, appealing to the
                vivid Eastern imagination as such figures do with us to the
                minds of children. The woes of men at the hands of heathen
                nations is the evident content of this trumpet, as is clearly
                indicated in the twentieth verse of the chapter. At this
                point the second woe is declared to be past, and the third to
                be about to come quickly (ch. 11:14); but between them
                intervenes a vision of divine help, and of the value of the
                church's witness (ch. 10:1-11:13).</p>

                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This view
                of the fifth and sixth trumpets seems to meet more fully the
                statements of the text than other views, and to conform best

                recognized obscurity of the trumpet visions, we can surely
                discern divine judgments for wrongdoing in the first four,
                under forms of physical evil visited upon the natural
                creation, and in the remaining three, manifestations of moral
                evil visited upon men for their sin. That the pit or abyss
                points to demoniacal forces, and the Euphrates to human
                agencies, is sufficiently evident without discussion.<a id=

                The application of the incidents of the fifth and sixth
                trumpets to Mohammedans and Turks by some of the historical
                school, who have even interpreted the tails of the horses as
                a prophetic reference to these well-known symbols of
                authority used by Turkish Pashas, is a curious example of
                capricious fancy. The fact that the events predicted under
                the sixth trumpet find a wide exemplification in the
                incursions of Turk and Mohammedan, Goth and Vandal, is only a
                clearer proof of their ideal character. And it is surely
                better to leave these highly wrought imaginative symbols of
                the trumpets, with their deep suggestiveness of appalling
                forms of coming evil, in the vague indefiniteness in which we
                find them, rather than to mar their beauty by weak and narrow
                interpretations.</p>

                reward has come (the Victory Chorus); by the ark of the
                covenant, the token of God's abiding presence, being revealed
                in the opened temple in heaven—a traditional sign in the
                later Judaism of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page150">[pg

                and by lightnings, voices, thunders, and an earthquake with
                great hail, the necessary accompaniments in Jewish thought of
                the great and final day of wrath: the multiple symbol of the
                final judgment, and of the glorious triumph of God's kingdom.
                The contents of the seventh trumpet are not fully developed,
                perhaps because they are too great for description, but in it
                we reach the climax and issue of the whole process of
                judgment that is exhibited in the series, the full and final
                establishment of the kingdom. The result is viewed in its
                entirety, and the millennial period of victory is not brought
                separately into view. The unveiling of the ark of covenant
                mercy and the ushering in of the kingdom close the vision,
                and constitute an informal transition to the vision of
                conflict through which the triumph has been effected.</p>

                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If we now
                rapidly recall the whole course of the seven trumpets, we can
                see how with progressive movement they increase in severity
                as they go forward; the judgments they prefigure fall first
                upon the land, and then consecutively upon the sea, upon the
                fountains of water, and upon the heavenly bodies, as signs of
                God's judgment upon the physical universe, and thus upon men
                who in their earthly lives form part of the natural world;
                then with the fifth trumpet the judgments take a wider trend,
                and point to and include the setting free of numberless
                demonic forces of evil from the pit of the abyss to prey upon
                men, and under the sixth trumpet the loosing of the
                multitudinous world-forces of heathenism from the banks of
                the Euphrates to bring world-wide judgments upon the race,
                thus preparing the way for the blowing of the seventh trumpet
                which ushers in the day of cumulative wrath upon sin, and the
                final triumph of God's kingdom. This onward progress of the
                plan of the ages is only broken by a passing view of the
                possibility of recovery for men in the episode of the angel
                and the book, and of the two witnesses, which follows. The
                whole sweep of the judgments of the trumpets, in the view of
                Apocalyptic perspective, is toward the end of the present
                world and the triumph of righteousness in the final judgment.
                There the redeemed are left with God in his glorious kingdom;
                the after life is not attempted to be described; its
                blessings are evidently <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

                comprehension. But the triumph would not be so definite,
                without the vision of conflict which follows, for it presents
                the path to victory through prevailing trial and opposition
                as ever leading on to complete and final triumph in the end,
                that is to be realized in the glorious presence of the Lamb
                who is revealed as standing upon Mount Zion in the midst of
                the redeemed.</p>

            10:1-11:13</span></h3>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This twofold
            vision forms a digression between the sixth and seventh trumpets,
            similar to the episode between the sixth and seventh seals,
            setting forth the opportunities which God has afforded men of
            escaping his wrath, showing the divine method of help through the
            institutions of religion, and affirming the permanent value of
            the church's witness,—a paragraph that notwithstanding its
            acknowledged difficulty, is manifestly interposed for the comfort
            of the church as well as to prepare the way for the last woe of
            the remaining trumpet.<a id="noteref_432" name="noteref_432"

            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">432</span></span></a> The
            restraint of wrath indicated by the destruction of only the third
            part under the trumpets, is now further developed by showing the
            divine offer of escape; and also man's common neglect of that
            offer, which leads at length to final doom under the seventh
            trumpet. The episode, it will be seen, differs in theme from the
            one under the seals, the former setting forth the divine side of
            redemption, and the surety of its accomplishment through the act
            of sealing, the latter showing the human side of redemption as it
            is made known to men through the institutions of religion, and
            the failure of its universal operation through unbelief, leaving
            the world without excuse to bear the weight of judgment—the one
            throwing light upon God's relation to the church, and the other
            upon his relation to the world, in accordance with the general
            theme of the seals and the trumpets. Though many are unable to
            agree that John had such a comprehensive view in mind, or that it
            is to be looked for in a writing of this class, yet when we
            consider the various marks of elaborate structure in <span class=

            "Pg152" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the book, exhibited in the
            relation of its different parts, and the deep prophetic insight
            and poetic intuition manifested by the author in his idealization
            of the course of the church, we need not be surprised to find a
            broad and perspicuous view of redemption such as this, especially
            since the plan of salvation had already been so fully elaborated
            in an earlier period by the great Apostle to the Gentiles.</p>

              The Angel with the Little Open Book, Ch. 10:1-11</h4>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first
              part of the episode exhibits the revelation of God's will and
              purpose as a source of help. The little book in the vision is
              evidently the Apocalypse, though in a broader sense it
              doubtless represents as well the general purpose and beneficent
              effects of all God's revelations to men; and the book is found
              open to indicate that its contents are made known to the world.
              Some regard the little book to be the remaining part of the
              Apocalypse, beginning with the succeeding chapter;<a id=
              "noteref_433" name="noteref_433" href="#note_433"><span class=

              by others its contents are considered to begin with chapter
              twelve, the first break in continuity after the episode; but it
              seems more likely that the whole book is intended. In any case
              it is clear that the prophetic form in which the writer's
              ministry is to be realized (viz. <span class="tei tei-q">“thou
              must prophesy again over many peoples and nations and tongues
              and kings”</span>, v. 11) serves to link the center of the book
              (ch. 10:11) with both the beginning (ch. 1:3) and the end (ch.
              22:19),<a id="noteref_434" name="noteref_434" href=

              and thereby furnishes an incidental proof of its unity of
              design.</p>

                  by a voice from heaven to seal them up and is forbidden to

                  voice in judgment are for the present hidden from men;
                  though some regard the voices as introduced only to
                  emphasize the element of mystery with which the Apocalyptic
                  form always delighted to clothe its thought. The voice,

                is Christ's revelation to John in the Apocalypse, a little
                open book or scroll (v. 2), evidently set in contrast with
                the great sealed book of God's purposes in chapter five; and
                it is taken by the Apostle, in obedience to a voice out of
                heaven, from the hand of the angel, who commands him to eat
                it, thereby indicating that John should digest the prophecy
                therein contained (Ezek. 3:1-3).<a id="noteref_437" name=

                Though it was sweet to his taste at first as a message from
                Christ, it became bitter afterward when its deeper meaning
                was understood, for it told of long continued trial and
                conflict instead of speedy triumph and victory. The prophecy
                is declared to be <span class="tei tei-q">“over [i. e.
                concerning] many peoples and nations and tongues and
                kings”</span>, a fourfold prediction, showing its world-wide
                application and indicating its ideal content.</p>

                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was the
                common thought of the early church that the period of the
                Christian dispensation would be very brief; and it may have
                been in order to dispel in some measure this illusion, and at
                the same time to inculcate patience and hope by showing the
                ideal shortness of the Christian age in God's eternal plan,
                that we are to find one of the many purposes of the
                Apocalypse. For it should be noted that by the end of the
                first century the view-point on this subject shows a material
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page154">[pg 154]</span><a name=
                "Pg154" id="Pg154" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> change. The
                attitude of John's Gospel toward the second coming of Christ
                is manifestly different from that of the Synoptists;<a id=
                "noteref_438" name="noteref_438" href=

                the significant predictions of Christ concerning his own
                return are omitted, notably the discourse on the last things
                (Mt. 24; Mk. 13; Lk. 21); and the only references to his
                coming again are indirect (Jn. 14:3, 18, 28; 16:22; and
                22:22-3), though from these it is evident that it is subsumed
                throughout, a view that is confirmed by the Epistles (I Jn.
                2:28; and 3:2). This is far from showing, as some hold, that
                the coming predicted was only figurative, and was fulfilled
                at the destruction of Jerusalem, an event already past when
                John's Gospel was written; but seems rather to indicate that
                the earlier stage of thought, shared in by all the apostles,
                which expected the Lord's return within the first generation,
                had given way to a new and wider outlook which emphasized the
                continuous coming that is present and spiritual more than the
                personal coming that is future and outward, though without
                losing faith in the surety of that coming. And even if the
                later date of the Apocalypse be not conceded, yet coming from
                the same source as the Fourth Gospel, we might not
                unnaturally expect to find in it some anticipation of this
                view involving delay, for the coming thought of in the
                visions is undoubtedly personal and future.</p>

                1 The Measurement of the Temple, Ch. 11:1-2</h5>

                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The ναὸς,
                or inner sanctuary of the temple of God, is at this point
                introduced in the vision, a term which applied to the
                apartments of the temple building proper, including the holy
                of holies, the holy place, and in this case by implication
                the inner court, as distinguished from the ἱερὸν which
                applied to the whole temple and included all the buildings
                with the outer courts. The ναὸς in classical Greek is the
                sanctuary or cell of a temple where the image of the god was
                placed. In <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page155">[pg

                at Jerusalem, it signifies the sacred edifice so called,
                including the holy and most holy place.<a id="noteref_439"

                Thus it is the true temple with the altar and them that
                worship therein, i. e. the entire contents of the inner
                court, the combined symbol of revealed religion and of those
                who accept its truths, especially the revelation and
                worshippers according to the Old Testament, which is here
                introduced in the vision. This is directed to be measured, i.
                e. it is to be subjected to careful scrutiny, and its
                proportions are to be observed, the sign as in Zechariah (ch.
                2:1f.) of preservation and renewal, and not of destruction.
                The measurement apparently applies to the heavenly temple,
                though it may be interpreted either of the temple at
                Jerusalem or its counterpart in heaven, for to the Jewish
                mind the earthly temple was the type and shadow of the
                heavenly (Heb. 9:5).<a id="noteref_440" name="noteref_440"

                In either case the meaning is the same, viz. only that which
                corresponds to the outer court of the earthly,<a id=

                the unessential portion, is given up by the fall of Jerusalem
                to be trodden underfoot of the nations (Lk. 21:24) during
                forty-two months (v. 2), the indefinite period of the world's
                conflict with the church (see <a href="#Appendix_E" class=
                "tei tei-ref">App'x. E</a>). The true temple with its
                worshippers, the heart and center of the religious life of
                Israel, is indestructible and reappears in heaven with the
                ark of the covenant restored (v. 19). This is a symbolic
                expression of the important truth that the revealed religion
                of Israel is to endure, the best in Judaism is imperishable,
                all that is fundamental and essential is preserved though the
                outer form be destroyed;<a id="noteref_442" name=

                and it was designed to be <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
                "page156">[pg 156]</span><a name="Pg156" id="Pg156" class=

                Christians, who naturally regarded the ruin of the temple as
                a profound calamity. The vision has been regarded by many
                interpreters as indicating that the temple and the city of
                Jerusalem were still standing when this was written, thus
                confirming the earlier date of the Revelation (circ. A. D.
                69); but the weight of evidence to be attached to an
                Apocalyptic vision as testimony in such a case is very small,
                and is quite insufficient when compared with other evidences
                of the historical situation found in the book.<a id=

                It is evident, also, that there is a reference in the
                symbolism here used, i. e. in the preservation not only of
                the altar, but <span class="tei tei-q">“of them that worship
                therein”</span>, to the preservation of the Jews as a people,
                and their future restoration when the times of the Gentiles
                shall be fulfilled (Lu. 21:24), though not necessarily to
                Palestine,<a id="noteref_444" name="noteref_444" href=
                "#note_444"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

                and surely not to a rebuilded temple, which in any case would
                be mere incidents, but to the richer blessings of renewed
                fellowship with God, of which the temple and its service were
                to the Jewish mind the truest type (cf. Rom. 11:1f.). The
                late Apocalyptic-Traditional view, it may be mentioned,
                attributes verses one and two to a former Jewish apocalypse
                that has been lost, which is here quoted as an introduction
                to the prophecy of the two witnesses that follows. It may
                well be doubted, however, whether this theory of the origin
                of the passage adds anything effective to its
                interpretation.</p>

                witnesses who prophesy, i. e. bear witness for God, and whom
                God ever preserves throughout all vicissitudes, and delivers
                even out of seeming destruction, are the churches of the Old
                and New Dispensations which have been divinely called to
                witness for the truth.<a id="noteref_445" name="noteref_445"

                revelations which supply oil, the symbol of grace, to the two

                the Jewish and Christian, that have been and are God's
                special witnesses throughout the ages (cf. Zech. 4:2f.).
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page157">[pg 157]</span><a name=
                "Pg157" id="Pg157" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> The identity
                of the candlesticks and witnesses is shown both by the
                connection, and by the explicit statement of verse four:
                <span class="tei tei-q">“These [two witnesses] are the two
                olive trees and the two candlesticks, standing before the
                Lord of the earth,”</span> i. e. the witnesses are, in a
                sense, both the Old and New Testament revelations and the
                churches of the Old and New Dispensations, which alike
                witness for the truth of God, though the connection shows
                that the churches are specially intended.<a id="noteref_447"
                name="noteref_447" href="#note_447"><span class=

                "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">447</span></span></a>
                Two is the number of confirmation in witness-bearing (Jn.
                8:17); hence the two witnesses may also be considered to
                symbolize the sufficiency of the testimony of the Old and New
                Testament churches, as also a sufficient number in the church
                in every age who witness for God and truth. These have power
                that is not of man but divinely given, as is indicated in
                symbolic language (v. 5-6), yet when their testimony is
                finished, the Beast out of the abyss, the world-power of
                chapter thirteen, introduced here by anticipation,
                accomplishes their apparent overthrow. Out of this deadly
                conflict with the world, and the apparent defeat and
                eventually the death of the witnesses, with the exposure of
                their dead bodies and contemptuous refusal of burial, a
                personal indignity and sign of hatred and contempt, the
                fitting type of the world's treatment of the church in all
                ages and times, which in the vision occurs in Babylon,
                <span class="tei tei-q">“the great city”</span>, the type of
                the godless world,—out of all this seeming defeat comes
                ultimate victory. After three and a half days the breath of
                life from God enters into them, and they live again, and go
                up to heaven in a cloud. This points to the experience of
                grave peril by the church preceding her triumph, including
                temporary and seeming extinction at the hands of her enemies,
                and forming the occasion for an expression of their supreme
                contempt, an experience such as has occurred at different
                periods in her history, and which may, indeed, occur again in
                the future—the church persecuted, scattered, peeled,
                seemingly destroyed, but revived and restored by the power of
                God. Three and a half days of defeat,—a broken number,
                indicating a short but indefinite period in contrast with the
                three and a half years, or forty-two months, or a thousand
                two hundred and three score days, (v. 3), the length of the
                entire world-conflict,—a time of rejoicing by <span class=

                earth, is followed, as in the case of our Lord, by
                resurrection, ascension, and triumph, a parallel that is
                apparently suggested by the similarity and was doubtless
                intended. This is true not only of individual saints who have
                borne witness and suffered death only to rise again in the
                witness of others and in their own personal resurrection, but
                is especially true of the church in a collective sense, both
                under the Old Testament and the New, which always rises
                triumphant after every great disaster in her history, and
                shall rise again in all her members at the resurrection of
                the last day after her witness is complete.<a id=

                God avenges his own, as is indicated in the vision by the
                fall of the tenth part of the city, which is the share of the
                tithe under the Mosaic law, and by the death of seven
                thousand men, a great and complete number, seven multiplied
                by a thousand, who bear the punishment of their sin. As the
                result of the martyrdom and avengement the rest of men, give
                glory to God, a manifest attestation of the value of the
                church's witness. The world's persecution, though bitter and
                continued, fails to accomplish its end; the church of Christ
                survives, and rises again in power, and its witness becomes
                effective. Historical interpreters, however, generally regard
                the two witnesses as persons, futurists identifying them as
                Moses (or Enoch) and Elijah, whom they regard as yet to come,
                and preterists finding in them two leading characters during
                the siege of Jerusalem by Titus, a view that restricts the
                vision to very narrow limits. Others, catching the larger
                view, interpret as <span class="tei tei-q">“The Christian
                church and the Christian state”</span>, and still others as
                <span class="tei tei-q">“The law and the prophets”</span>, or
                <span class="tei tei-q">“The prophets and the
                priesthood”</span>,—i. e. the whole spiritual authority of
                the old dispensation which, <span class="tei tei-q">“though
                perverted and destroyed by the Jews (some of the best
                representatives of each being put to death), yet rose to new
                life and enthronement in Christianity”</span>. In any case
                the obvious teaching is the triumph of faithful testimony for
                God, a principle of inestimable value for the church when in
                the throes of persecution. And now, having looked on the
                vision of the angel and the book, and of the two witnesses,
                the way is open for the sounding of the seventh
                trumpet.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page159">[pg

                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It may be
                noted in closing our study of this episode that many
                commentators interpret <span class="tei tei-q">“the great
                city”</span>, in verse eight of this chapter, as referring to
                Jerusalem, because of the designation <span class=
                "tei tei-q">“where also their Lord was
                crucified”</span>—Jerusalem being regarded as a world-city.
                The decisive reason against this, however, is the uniform
                usage of the book,<a id="noteref_449" name="noteref_449"
                href="#note_449"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
                "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">449</span></span></a>
                for the interpretation is not otherwise materially affected.
                Jerusalem is everywhere else in the Revelation the type of
                that which is holy, and is nowhere else called <span class=
                "tei tei-q">“the great city”</span>, while this name is
                applied seven times elsewhere to Babylon (or Rome), the type
                of the ungodly world, in which and by which our Lord may be
                truly said to have been crucified; and there seems to be no
                adequate reason for regarding this passage as containing an
                exceptional use of the phrase. Whether, however, we interpret
                of Jerusalem or of Babylon the general sense remains the
                same. In the one case the apparent defeat and contempt for
                the church of God, or its witness and witnesses, occurs in
                Babylon, the type of the godless world, while in the other it
                happens in Jerusalem, in that case the type of unbelieving
                Judaism. Either symbolism, it will be seen, is suitable to
                the context.</p>

            pervasive church-historic world-conflict of the evil against the
            just, now forms the essential climax of the Revelation,
            disclosing a divine panorama of the world in process of
            redemption with the great opposing forces which contend against
            Christ and his kingdom; a discriminating outlook upon the
            significant world-movements of all time from the spiritual point
            of view, for it is everywhere assumed that the forces which mould
            history are spiritual, and that the master key to life is found
            in the supernatural. And, whatever the form in which these
            movements became apparent to John in his time, we may rest
            assured that the divinely inspired prophetic insight led him to
            perceive, at least in some measure, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page160">[pg 160]</span><a name="Pg160" id="Pg160" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> that in their essence they were timeless
            and repeated themselves in every age. This central vision is in
            part the most difficult portion of the Revelation, containing
            seven mystic figures, viz. the Sun-Clothed Woman, the Great Red
            Dragon, the All-Ruling Man-Child, the First Beast (the Beast from
            the Sea), the Second Beast (the Beast from the Land), the Lamb on
            Mount Zion, and the Son of Man on the Cloud, each one of whom is
            invested with a special symbolism. The difficulties of
            interpretation belonging to this part of the Revelation, it will
            be seen, are scarcely lessened in any degree by referring
            different parts of the section to various Jewish apocalypses
            which are supposed to have contained the gist of the thought in
            this portion, according to the Apocalyptic-Traditional
            view;<a id="noteref_450" name="noteref_450" href=

            for, apart from the fact that no such apocalypses are now extant,
            these sections, even if they were originally derived from such a
            source, have an application here that is distinctively new and
            specifically Christian. The vision itself is properly divisible
            into four parts or sections, as indicated in the arrangement that
            follows.</p>

                recurrent changes, it naturally formed a ready type of both
                these ideas; and it may here also include the thought of

                mainly to enhance the conception of the church's ideal glory.
                The crown of twelve stars is the sign of the covenant
                people,—the crown is στέφανος, the crown of victory, which
                God designs to give the church, and the number, twelve, is
                the number of the tribes of Israel—while the woman's travail
                anguish is the figure of Jewish affliction, and of deep
                longing for the Messiah. Some interpret the figure of the
                woman as representing the Virgin Mary;<a id="noteref_452"

                the lord of the present world and the adversary of Christ.
                His seven heads with diadems, and the ten horns, are symbols
                of his full dominion and absolute power over evil in the
                world during the period of conflict. The head with a crown or
                diadem is the natural symbol of dominion, which in the
                Apocalyptic literature usually signifies kings or empires
                (cf. Dan. 2:32; and 7:6), and the horn is a recognized Jewish
                emblem of power. The crown is the διάδημα, the sign of
                royalty, not the στέφανος, or garland crown of victory—a
                distinction that is carefully observed in the Revelation, as
                is indicated in the Revised Versions by the translation
                <span class="tei tei-q">“diadem”</span>.<a id="noteref_454"

                This symbolism of the seven heads and ten horns was evidently
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page162">[pg 162]</span><a name=
                "Pg162" id="Pg162" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> chosen to
                indicate the manifestation of Satan's power in the kings and
                kingdoms of this world which are adverse to the kingdom of
                God, as is clearly shown by their use in chapter
                thirteen,—that through which Satan operates and makes his
                power felt being attributed to him as an essential part of
                his being. The use of seven and ten together implies a
                twofold completeness, i. e. completeness of kind and
                completeness of parts (see <a href="#Appendix_E" class=
                "tei tei-ref">App'x. E</a>). This combination of seven, the
                symbol of perfection of quality which is usually moral, with
                ten the symbol of completeness which is usually earthly,
                though without necessarily implying any moral element, is
                used with an evil significance throughout in the Revelation,
                and creates some difficulty of interpretation; but it is
                doubtless best explained as indicating that that which was
                originally designed for moral perfection, signified by seven,
                has been combined with and prostituted to purely earthly
                ends, as signified by ten, which ends are in this case
                notably sinful. The suitability of the seven heads and ten
                horns belonging alike to the Dragon, who represents Satan,
                and to the Beast (ch. 13:1), who represents anti-Christian
                national government, is thus quite manifest, for both are
                evil. If we compare this with the combination of seven with
                seven in the horns and eyes of the Lamb, where the idea of a
                twofold spiritual perfection is indicated, something of the
                peculiar combination and significance of numbers in the
                Revelation will become apparent. The Dragon's casting down
                the third part of the stars from heaven (v. 4), i. e. a
                considerable number but not the larger part, is another sign
                of his power (Dan. 8:10), and may allude to the angels who
                lost their first estate and fell with him. He stands waiting
                in the vision before the Woman, the church, in order to
                destroy her child, the Messiah, as soon as the child is born,
                a purpose that he does not prove able to carry out.</p>

                messianic kingdom. There may also be a reference in this to
                the lands of the Gentiles, called a wilderness in contrast
                with Canaan the glorious land to the Jewish patriot, where
                the church <span class="tei tei-q">“hath a place prepared of
                God”</span>, and is now nourished like Israel of old in the
                wilderness; or, by a change of figure, like the prophet
                Elijah was fed for twelve hundred and sixty days, the
                equivalent of forty-two months, or three and a half
                years,—the time, [two] times, and half a time, i. e. three
                and a half times, of verse fourteen,—the symbol of the
                indefinite period of the church's conflict with the world, or
                of the world-triumph, which is a shortened time, a term that
                will end (see <a href="#Appendix_E" class="tei tei-ref">App'x
                E</a>). It may be mentioned here that the preterist
                interpreters usually regard the wilderness refuge as a
                reference to the flight of the Christians to Pella before
                Jerusalem was destroyed, by which they escaped the three and
                a half years of the siege<a id="noteref_455" name=

                inscribed upon the Roman standards, may have seemed the
                symbol of the Roman Empire that at first protected
                Christianity from Jewish persecution,<a id="noteref_456"

                of the Woman's seed, i. e. all of her seed except Jesus
                Christ, who was caught up to heaven, indicates his continued

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have in
              this incident a digression in the midst of the account of the
              persecution of the Woman in order to show the origin of Satan's
              hatred, and the beginning of the conflict in the far
              past.<a id="noteref_457" name="noteref_457" href=

              Michael the archangel, regarded as the presiding angel of the
              Jews from the time of Daniel, together with the angels under
              him, warred with the Dragon and his angels; and Satan, being
              cast out of heaven, transferred the conflict to earth. A great
              voice is then heard in heaven declaring his downfall together
              with the triumph of the kingdom of God, and recounting the
              suffering of the saints because of him (v. 10-12). This term
              which is here introduced, <span class="tei tei-q">“the kingdom
              of our God”</span>, though used but twice in the book of the
              Revelation, is the most notable phrase in the New Testament. It
              occurs nearly a hundred times, either as <span class=
              "tei tei-q">“the kingdom of God”</span>, or <span class=
              "tei tei-q">“the kingdom of heaven”</span>, a term which
              signifies the rule of God in the earth, God becoming king among
              men. The kingdom of God, it should be seen, has a far broader
              meaning and wider sweep than the church, for it serves to
              include all that God is ever doing the ages through for the
              spiritual uplift and permanent betterment of mankind. In the
              broadest sense this beneficent kingdom may be defined as all
              that divinely directed movement and control in human life and
              history which has for its object the ultimate accomplishment of
              the mind and will of God in the hearts and lives of men—for
              this glorious kingdom on the earthly side has its ultimate seat
              within the human heart (Lu. 17:21). Jesus by his luminous
              teaching lifted that name, <span class="tei tei-q">“the kingdom
              of God”</span>, out <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page165">[pg
              165]</span><a name="Pg165" id="Pg165" class=
              "tei tei-anchor"></a> of the older and narrower phases of its
              Jewish use, and gave it a broader and more beneficent meaning
              for all succeeding time. The casting out of Satan, which is
              related in this section, is introduced as a contributive event
              to the glorious coming of the kingdom. His defeat in heaven
              foreshadows his defeat on earth, and though he still has
              <span class="tei tei-q">“great wrath”</span> which he pours out
              upon men, yet 'he hath but a short time' (v. 12), i. e. a time
              that is relatively short, until Christ shall reign in power.
              They who are our brethren overcame him, we are told (v. 11),
              <span class="tei tei-q">“because of the blood of the
              Lamb”</span>, therefore they are called upon to rejoice. In
              connection with this interpretation it should not be forgotten
              that the time-relation is, in this view, ignored in the vision,
              as commonly throughout the book, for Apocalyptic often does not
              separate the near and the far, and events widely separated in
              time are viewed as contemporaneous in the timeless sequence of
              prophetic perspective. Thus the incident before us without any
              intimation takes us back to the period anterior to creation,
              and then recurs as suddenly to the experience of persecution by
              faithful Christians.<a id="noteref_458" name="noteref_458"

              In all Apocalyptic writings there is a manifest indifference to
              formal consistency that we do well to bear in mind.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">According to
              another view the account in this section is to be regarded as
              continuous with the last, verse seven following verse six in
              natural order, and the conflict described is to be placed after
              the resurrection of Christ, making the victory a shortening of
              Satan's power following upon Christ's redemptive work, and
              depriving him of such opportunity as he hitherto had in heaven
              of accusing the brethren, thereby limiting his sphere to this
              world. Notwithstanding the attractiveness of this view,
              however, and what may be said in its favor from several
              passages in the Gospels (cf. Lk. 10:18; Jn. 12:31; 14:30b; and
              16:11),<a id="noteref_459" name="noteref_459" href=

              "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">459</span></span></a>
              the former interpretation is upon the whole to be preferred as
              agreeing best with the general sense of the chapter.<a id=
              "noteref_460" name="noteref_460" href="#note_460"><span class=

              Such a symbol of victory over Satan, whatever the period to
              which the victory may be attributed, was not out of accord with
              ideas <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page166">[pg
              166]</span><a name="Pg166" id="Pg166" class=
              "tei tei-anchor"></a> current at that time; for <span class=
              "tei tei-q">“this feature impossible in modern conceptions of
              heaven, shows itself from time to time in pre-Christian and
              also early Christian conceptions, viz. the belief in the
              presence of evil, or the possibility of its appearance, in the
              heavens”</span> [i. e. in the lower heavens].<a id=

              "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">461</span></span></a>
              In any case this section places in clear perspective the great
              truth that leadership in the antagonism of evil with
              righteousness belongs to and takes its rise from the
              supernatural world, and what we constantly see here has its
              source and occasion there, in the deeper spiritual vision of
              prophecy.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the
              interpretation of this section a manifest parallelism has been
              pointed out between the conflict of Marduk with Tiâmat in
              Babylonian mythology, and the war between Michael and the
              Dragon in the Apocalypse.<a id="noteref_462" name="noteref_462"
              href="#note_462"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
              "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">462</span></span></a>
              Others pursuing this idea still further, though without
              sufficient ground for their conclusion, have attributed to
              Babylonian origin a body of Jewish apocalyptic traditions which
              they assume to have been one of the sources of the Revelation
              and to have furnished the incident of this section.<a id=
              "noteref_463" name="noteref_463" href="#note_463"><span class=
              "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
              "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">463</span></span></a>
              In correction of this position it should be seen that even when
              we recognize to the fullest extent the necessary influence of
              contact with Babylon, both early and late, upon Jewish thought,
              and the introduction of ideas from that source as natural and
              inevitable, it does not follow that there was any such use made
              of Babylonian mythology in the later Jewish writings as this
              would imply, for the Jew was exceedingly wary of any religious
              ideas that did not spring from his own ancestral heritage. It
              is indeed quite probable that particular concepts, or
              thought-elements, like that of the Dragon and of the two Beasts
              in this vision, are of Babylonian origin; but <span class=
              "tei tei-q">“the hypothesis of a Jewish messianic use of an
              entire heathen sun-myth, and then the Christian adaptation of
              the Jewish form”</span>,<a id="noteref_464" name="noteref_464"

              is in itself highly improbable at so late a period in Jewish
              development, and can scarcely be accepted by those who maintain
              the inspiration of the Apocalypse in any essential sense. It is
              much more likely <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page167">[pg
              167]</span><a name="Pg167" id="Pg167" class=

              at all, incorporated the thought rather than the form of such
              floating Babylonian fragments as belonged to his time, in
              accordance with his usual method of employing the Hebrew
              literature, though this is wholly a matter of hypothesis.<a id=

              The Two Beasts, Ch. 13:1-18</h4>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The vision
              now sets forth two of the principal forms of the world's
              opposition to Christ and his kingdom, which are represented as
              Beasts, monsters that are terrible and revolting in appearance,
              that are placed in notable contrast with the Lamb, and that are
              inspired by Satan who stands watching in his dragon form on the
              sands of the sea—for according to the corrected reading of the
              Revised Version, it is the Dragon and not the Apocalyptist that
              stands upon the seashore.<a id="noteref_466" name="noteref_466"

              "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">466</span></span></a>
              This vision affords an interesting example of John's use of
              already existing material, for the idea of two wild beasts
              opposing the Messiah is found elsewhere in apocalyptic
              writings, although not in exactly the same form,<a id=
              "noteref_467" name="noteref_467" href="#note_467"><span class=
              "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
              "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">467</span></span></a>
              and is here made the basis of an illustration of undoubted
              power. The Beasts in the Apocalypse are the natural and fitting
              embodiment of brute force operating to control men in the
              sphere of religion. Some would prefer the translation of θηρίον
              as a <span class="tei tei-q">“monster”</span> rather than a
              <span class="tei tei-q">“beast”</span>,<a id="noteref_468"

              and perhaps, it is technically more accurate, but the long use
              of the term <span class="tei tei-q">“beast”</span> in this
              connection has made it familiar to our minds and also
              intelligible, for it is a beast in the bad sense that is
              intended, and to the average reader this term undoubtedly
              conveys the proper meaning.</p>

                national opposition to Christianity, exemplified by heathen
                Rome in John's day which supplied the groundwork of the
                conception, but extending far beyond that and applying
                equally to all persecuting nations during the whole forty-two
                months, or three and a half years, of world-domination, which
                represents the duration of the church-historic period of
                trial (v. 5), a period that is broken and incomplete (see
                <a href="#Appendix_E" class="tei tei-ref">App'x E</a>). The
                Beast is described as having ten horns and seven heads, the
                symbol of a twofold completeness, both that of parts (ten)
                and that of quality or kind (seven), the same number as the
                Dragon, though in inverse order, indicating that the Beast is
                the agent of the Dragon, i. e. of Satan, and is possessed of
                like dominion and power,—for <span class="tei tei-q">“the
                Dragon gave him his power, and his throne, and great
                authority”</span>. The heads seem to symbolize the
                world-power taking form, and the horns the exercise of that
                power. (For the further development of this symbolism, see
                ch. 17:9f.) And it should be noted that the ten horns and
                seven heads are common not only to the Dragon and the Beast,
                but are also the sum total of those belonging to the four
                beasts in Daniel's vision, i. e. to all the world-powers
                there designed, a symbolism which suggests that it properly
                applies to more than one nation, and which here seems
                intended to portray the persistent opposition of the Devil to
                the church of God, working through the power of the world in
                all time and in all nations. The ten crowns or diadems upon
                his horns denote the fulness of his sovereignty, and imply
                the extent of his earthly rule; the names of blasphemy upon
                his heads seem to refer to the divine titles and honors
                assumed by earthly kings, especially those of Rome, as
                Domitian who ordered that in official documents he should be
                styled <span class="tei tei-q">“Our Lord and God”</span>—a

                mitre of the high priest on which was written <span class=

                while the wounded head that is healed refers to the death
                stroke, given to the world-power by the life, death, and
                resurrection of Jesus Christ, from which there has been
                seeming recovery,<a id="noteref_471" name="noteref_471" href=

                for this was a true deathblow to the world-power, even though
                it failed of immediate realization and thereby disappointed
                Jewish-Christian hopes of early victory. The Beast blasphemes
                against God, <span class="tei tei-q">“his name, and his
                tabernacle, even them that dwell in the heavens”</span>, i.
                e. the inhabitants of the tabernacle. <span class=
                "tei tei-q">“And it was given unto him to make war with the
                saints and to overcome them: and there was given to him
                authority over every tribe and people and tongue and
                nation”</span>; but it is only as it is <span class=
                "tei tei-q">“given unto him”</span> that he can exercise his
                power, i. e. he is subject to divine control. And every one,
                <span class="tei tei-q">“whose name hath not been written
                from the foundation of the world in the book of life of the
                Lamb that hath been slain”</span>, shall worship him. Thus is
                depicted not only the fierce antagonism of the Roman Empire
                to the church in that age, but the perpetual hostility and
                unceasing opposition of the universal world-power in all ages
                and nations to the growth of the kingdom of God among
                men.</p>

                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The symbol
                of the Beast, notwithstanding the difficulty of its
                interpretation, has certain distinguishing features that help
                to interpret its meaning. The close resemblance to Daniel's
                vision gives a clue to the thought in mind, and serves to
                indicate the proper method of interpretation. That the
                world-power in some form is symbolized in the vision, is
                clearly indicated; on this point all interpreters are agreed,
                though the majority of modern interpreters regard the Beast
                as the Roman Empire. That John had Rome primarily in mind can
                scarcely be doubted; but, in the view accepted by the
                symbolic interpreters, the Roman Empire served only to supply
                the groundwork for an idealized conception, in which the
                ordinary and limited view of sense has become transformed
                under the influence of prophetic insight into the wider
                vision of a world-power belonging to all time and pervading
                all history that rises beastlike in strength and might to
                oppress the people of <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
                "page170">[pg 170]</span><a name="Pg170" id="Pg170" class=
                "tei tei-anchor"></a> God. The Beast, according to this
                interpretation, is the persecuting world-power in any and
                every age antagonizing the kingdom of God; the national and
                political forces of the world in their organized form
                arraying themselves against our Lord and his Christ; that
                phase of the world's life which finds expression for its
                opposition to the children of the kingdom under the forms of
                law and government, the most sovereign and irresistible of
                all kinds of persecution. This symbol naturally found a ready
                and satisfactory interpretation by the early church in the
                prevailing surveillance of the Roman authority; but it is an
                interpretation none the less true of heathen nations
                everywhere and always, who constantly persecute the church of
                God. The interpretation thus given is the one accepted by the
                symbolist school as the most natural and satisfactory of all,
                having a world-wide application and universal content; and it
                may be confidently adopted with an adequate degree of
                assurance that it conveys the meaning intended. The preterist
                interpreters, on the other hand, limit the meaning of the
                First Beast to the Roman Empire, using its power to oppose
                and oppress Christianity, and construe the wounded head as a
                reference to the death of Nero (see notes on chapter
                seventeen).</p>

                  adds a word of warning concerning the need of patience and
                  perseverance for the saints. If any one is ordained to

                signify that he appears to be like Christ, while he is like
                Satan; he represents the forms of religion that assume to
                save men, but in fact only bind them to evil. <span class=

                but a power counterfeiting the power of God as shown of old
                in fire from heaven, a great sign to Israel (Num. 16:35; I K.
                18:38), and sembling that of the two witnesses (ch. 11:5).

                false religions of the world, which the Second Beast
                represents, operate to make the people subservient to the
                world-power, the First Beast which had the stroke of the

                and the people render worship as they are directed.
                <span class="tei tei-q">“And it was given <span class=

                that it should speak and cause as many as should not worship
                the image to be killed”</span>, i. e. the heathen religions
                give life and authority to national worship, give vitality to
                the world-power that it should command and compel men to join
                in its idolatrous forms or lose their lives by refusal. Thus
                the whole figure seems to indicate the spirit of the world
                operating against the church through the forms of religion,
                especially as seizing upon the natural and ethnic religions,
                permeating them with deceit, and subverting them to worldly
                ends (v. 14), the element of religion being a prominent
                feature throughout. Actuated by worldly wisdom, which is
                <span class="tei tei-q">“earthly, sensual, and
                devilish”</span> (Jas. 3:15), this Beast, we are told, bids
                all men worship the image of the First (v. 12 and 14), i. e.
                worship the deification of the world-power, thereby
                insidiously rehabilitating the world-power in another form, a
                figure likely drawn from the worship of the Emperor's image,
                a cult prevailing at the time, and showing how false
                religions rest upon and are upheld by heathen governments.
                John doubtless had primarily in mind the heathen priesthood
                of that period, especially the priesthood of Caesar-worship,
                which afforded the best example of the then existing
                world-religions, but this only formed the groundwork of the
                larger thought of the vision. Preterist interpreters, as a
                rule, would limit the meaning of the Second Beast to the
                heathen priesthood of that time, but this is too restricted a
                view. Any religion anywhere rejecting the Christ and crowning
                the world-power is represented by the Second Beast. It has
                also been suggested that the Second Beast represents the
                Asiarch, or chief priest of Asia, the director and instigator
                of Emperor-worship.<a id="noteref_476" name="noteref_476"

                "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">476</span></span></a>
                This may possibly have been the source of John's idea; but
                however formed we should regard it as a universal and poetic
                conception of one continuous phase of the world's opposition
                to Christ and his kingdom, and not limit it to any particular
                historic <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page173">[pg

                Others, without sufficient grounds, have referred the title
                to the papacy, interpreting the First and Second Beasts as
                Rome pagan and papal. Another interpretation is that the
                First Beast is the secular persecuting power, pagan or
                Christian, and the Second Beast is the sacerdotal persecuting
                power, pagan and Christian; while still another and better
                interpretation is that world-force is the first, and
                world-worship, i. e. world-religion and superstition, the
                second.<a id="noteref_477" name="noteref_477" href=
                "#note_477"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

                Symbolist interpreters always prefer the wider to a narrower
                symbolism in accordance with their general view of the book.
                According to this view, which is the one accepted in the
                present volume, all the world-religions which profess to be
                holy but are controlled by the same spirit, belong to the
                Second Beast and contribute to his power. The aspect of
                heathenism which here presented itself to John's mind is the
                most general and obvious of all its many characteristics; and
                although we now recognize more fully the elements of truth in
                the ethnic religions, and their relative value in the moral
                education of mankind when without the gospel, yet John's view
                still holds good, and is confirmed by the world-wide
                testimony of the mission field. The world-spirit which lies
                at the door of the world-religions is and always has been
                evil, and will always be degrading to the soul, that spirit
                which subordinates the moral and spiritual to purely selfish
                and worldly ends. The forms of the Two-horned Beast today are
                just as deceiving and defiling to men, and as much opposed to
                the kingdom of God, as they ever were of old. And not only
                are all the world-religions the abiding manifestation of the
                Second Beast, but even the Christian church also, whether
                Catholic or Protestant, may become subservient thereto,
                whenever or wherever it, or any part of it, may be dominated
                by the spirit of the world-religions, and thereby yields its
                God-given prestige to this Beast. The forms of human
                learning, too, as philosophy, science, literature, and art,
                when they trench upon the sphere of religion and become
                atheistic, agnostic, materialistic, or God-defying, exhibit
                the spirit of the world-religions in opposition to Christ,
                and are manifestations of the same Beast. This power is
                world-wide and age-long, and the vision seems to look
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page174">[pg 174]</span><a name=
                "Pg174" id="Pg174" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> through and
                beyond the forces then at work to their wider manifestation
                in history. For the Second Beast is the incarnation of the
                permanent and universal world-religion in each and all of its
                forms, and while presenting one aspect of the world-religions
                of John's time, yet goes far beyond that and portrays the
                principle of opposition to the church of Christ which
                underlies them all, and which would develop new forms in the
                period when Christianity had nominally triumphed, continuing
                the conflict upon different lines from the violent
                persecutions of the earlier ages; a period when the world's
                opposition to God would be expressed <span class=
                "tei tei-q">“by affiliation with the religion of Jesus, and
                by penetrating its life with false ideals”</span>, producing
                a faithlessness within the church even more deadly in its
                results than the fatal furor of persecution, for the world
                within the church is one of the forms of the Second Beast,
                and there is nothing so dangerous to the life of the soul as
                irreligious religion.<a id="noteref_478" name="noteref_478"

                  <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
                  <span class="tei tei-q">“Here is wisdom”</span>, John says:
                  <span class="tei tei-q">“He that hath understanding, let
                  him count the number of the Beast; for it is the number of
                  a man”</span>,—or rather, <span class="tei tei-q">“the
                  number of man”</span>, for there is no article in the
                  Greek, implying that the reference is not to any particular
                  man—<a id="noteref_479" name="noteref_479" href=

                  i. e. it is a human number. The mark of the Beast, like
                  that of an ancient devotee to his idol, is put upon both
                  the hand and brain (v. 16)<a id="noteref_480" name=
                  "noteref_480" href="#note_480"><span class=

                  of all the people who accept his authority, without any
                  distinction of rank, rich and poor, bond and free, small
                  and great, all alike, showing that their powers are
                  uniformly devoted to the service of this world. John
                  exhorts the church to wisdom in discerning this Beast,
                  indicating the subtleness of his hidden power. The number
                  of his name, i. e. designation, is six hundred and
                  sixty-six (some manuscripts read six hundred and sixteen,
                  but this is almost certainly an error of transcription),
                  the symbol of a threefold, composite power of evil which
                  includes the Dragon, the First Beast, and the Second, and
                  which culminates <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page175">[pg

                  of six, a numerical designation of the Dragon, plus 60,
                  tenfold of six, a similar designation of the First Beast,
                  plus 6, onefold of six, a like designation of the Second
                  Beast, if considered alone, which together, equal 666, the
                  numerical designation of the full power which the Second
                  Beast represents. The key to the mystical designation 666,
                  according to this interpretation,<a id="noteref_481" name=
                  "noteref_481" href="#note_481"><span class=

                  is found in the number six, the number of evil, one short
                  of seven or perfection, Satan's number, whether multiplied
                  by ten or not, here thrice repeated, <span class=
                  "tei tei-hi"><span style=
                  "font-style: italic">six</span></span>, <span class=
                  "tei tei-hi"><span style=
                  "font-style: italic">six</span></span>, <span class=
                  "tei tei-hi"><span style=
                  "font-style: italic">six</span></span>, each repetition
                  multiplying the previous number tenfold, or six a
                  hundredfold added to six tenfold added to six a single
                  fold, producing a triple symbol of the full power of evil.
                  In this symbolism we seem to have the thought of a trinity
                  of evil striving in antagonism to the divine trinity; and
                  though we cannot be sure that John had this in mind, yet it
                  seems quite in accord with the apocalyptic method of
                  depicting truth. If the reading 616 is preferred, the First
                  Beast is then designated by 10, the symbol of earthly
                  completeness, instead of 60 as above, a much less likely
                  symbolism, but not affecting the general meaning.</p>

                  <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The mark
                  of the Beast is one of the most disputed points in the
                  whole book, and some commentators, while suggesting a
                  probable interpretation, prefer to leave the meaning
                  unsolved. Certainly all interpretations finding in the
                  number a cryptic name, such as <span class=
                  "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Neron
                  Caesar</span></span>, or <span class=
                  "tei tei-hi"><span style=
                  "font-style: italic">Lateinos</span></span>,
                  notwithstanding their wide acceptance by modern
                  interpreters, should be discarded as fanciful.<a id=

                  "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">482</span></span></a>
                  The number was evidently intended as a designation rather
                  than a name; it is a symbol like every other number in the
                  Revelation, and any attempt to solve it by reference to the
                  Jewish <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
                  "font-style: italic">gematria</span></span>, or numerical
                  indication of names, is foreign to the method of the book,
                  and only involves it in greater obscurity, as the different
                  answers obtained in that way will show.<a id="noteref_483"
                  name="noteref_483" href="#note_483"><span class=

                  "tei tei-anchor"></a> While that interpretation has been
                  the generally accepted view with preterists, a revolt
                  against its arbitrariness is manifest in late writers, and
                  cannot but be felt by the attentive student.<a id=

                  That six hundred and sixty-six is a triple symbol of the
                  full power of evil, has found acceptance with a multitude
                  of readers, and is the most satisfactory interpretation to
                  those who hold the symbolic view.</p>

                  <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In
                  conclusion it should be said that the identification of
                  this Beast, or of the former one, with the Antichrist of
                  John's Epistles is of more than doubtful value in arriving
                  at the meaning intended; for the Apocalyptist studiously
                  avoided the use of that term though quite familiar with it
                  (I Jn. 2:18; 2:22; 4:3; and II Jn. 1:7), and we surely
                  cannot do better than to follow his example. Indeed the
                  entire interpretation of the Apocalypse will be permanently
                  advanced when all direct reference to a <em class=
                  "tei tei-emph"><span style=
                  "font-style: italic">personal</span></em> Anti-christ is
                  finally eliminated as foreign to the purpose, if not the
                  thought of the book. In the broad sense of the term the
                  Anti-christ is the Against-Christ in any and every form.
                  John tells us (I Jn. 2:18) there are <span class=
                  "tei tei-q">“Many antichrists”</span> (ἀντίχριστοι πολλοὶ),
                  a term peculiar to John in the New Testament; our Lord said
                  (Mat. 24:24) <span class="tei tei-q">“There shall arise
                  false christs”</span> (ψευδόχριστοι), a different term in
                  the Greek, and evidently referring to more than one; and it
                  may well be doubted whether the prediction is anywhere
                  intended to refer to a single person. The term may be
                  understood in a general way to include the Two Beasts, the
                  Harlot, and all other forms of anti-christianity, but no
                  more definite identification can with any probability be
                  made.</p>

                here a vast and virgin multitude, a hundred and forty-four
                thousand, a large and perfect number, the former symbol of
                the complete first-fruits from Israel (ch. 7:4), now used by

                and who stand with the Lamb upon Mount Zion, in the city of
                the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, having his name and
                the name of his Father written upon their foreheads,

                and who sing a new song, the song of victory (the
                Incommunicable Chorus), known only to the redeemed. Of this
                blessed company it is said that <span class="tei tei-q">“they

                Futurists generally maintain that the vision refers to the
                earthly Zion, and connect the incident with the second
                advent, making the hundred and forty-four thousand to consist

                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These are
                distinct notes of divine warning, prelusive of the End, which
                are given by the mouth of three different angels, showing
                their separate and individual importance; they are three in
                number, the symbol of the spiritual, indicating the nature of
                their contents; and they are introduced as preparatory to the
                scenes of anticipated judgment in verses fourteen to twenty,
                and are premonitory of the End. The End is an ever-recurrent
                note that always finds place in the deeper strains of
                Apocalyptic literature. The End that victory may come, was
                the natural cry of a spirit that despaired of the present
                world, and believed that God could only be vindicated by the
                consummation of all things. This was a fundamental weakness
                of the Apocalyptic point of view, which found the proper
                design of the world in its speedy ending and not in its
                longer continuance, a mistake that unfortunately has been
                perpetuated in Christian thought as though it were
                fundamental to it, whereas the victory and the End may well
                be as far apart as the creation from the victory. The
                Apocalypse sounds the note of the End without hesitancy or
                discussion. The difficulties that embarrass us did not enter
                into the thought of that time.</p>

                at this point expresses his sympathy with the church, setting

                from out the temple that the hour was come, he cast his
                sickle upon the earth and gathered all the faithful into his
                kingdom as a harvest that was ripe, a symbol of the
                ingathering of all the redeemed preceding the punishment of
                the wicked (cf. Mat. 25:31-46). The action set forth in this
                part of the vision is preparatory to and anticipates the
                judgment, yet the process of judgment is not described. The
                vision is occupied rather with pointing out how the path of
                history inevitably leads to the judgment bar. The incident
                serves to introduce the seventh and last of the mystic
                figures of this wonderful vision of conflict, the Son of Man
                on the Cloud, who represents Christ as the theanthropic

                conditions of his mysterious incarnation, and therefore
                requiring an entirely different symbol.</p>

                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Still
                another angel came out from the shrine or sanctuary of the
                temple in heaven, at the summons of the angel who had power
                over fire, i. e. the fire of the altar, which is here the
                symbol of judgment, and gathered all the ungodly as vintage
                from the earth, and cast them into the winepress, the great
                winepress, of the wrath of God, a figure of the ingathering
                and fearful punishment of the wicked at the end of the world.
                According to this view the two gatherings described in verses
                fourteen to twenty, are regarded as depicting the opposite
                fate in store for the faithful and the wicked, instead of a
                twofold account of the same event repeated in different form
                for the purpose of emphasis. This interpretation agrees best
                with the general tenor of the chapter and the common method
                of contrast throughout the book; others, however, regard the
                passage as a double figure of the judgment.<a id=

                the New Jerusalem, the home of God's people, without the
                gates of which are the wicked who perish (ch. 22:15). The
                figure may have been drawn from the scenes of terror and
                bloodshed which attended the fall of the earthly city under
                Titus, a view quite possible if the later date of authorship
                be accepted, though possibly there may have been no definite
                city in mind. Some connect this passage with the struggle in
                chapter twenty (v. 7-10), where the nations compass the
                beloved city, and connect both with the advent, interpreting
                literally,—a view common with the futurists. And we are told
                that when the winepress was trodden <span class=
                "tei tei-q">“there came out blood, from the winepress, even
                unto the bridles of the horses,”</span><a id="noteref_491"

                a symbol of the terrible destruction of life that ensued, a
                flowing stream that reached as far as a thousand and six
                hundred furlongs, i. e. almost two hundred Roman miles, or
                somewhat farther than the entire length of Palestine, a
                Jewish synonym for a great distance. Sixteen hundred is also
                the square of four, the earth number, multiplied by the
                square of ten, the number of completeness, which perhaps
                indicates that the punishment is complete throughout the
                whole created world. The passage in its essential thought is
                an echo from the rhapsody of Joel (ch. 3:13), combined with
                the vision of judgment in Isaiah's Zion redeemed (ch.
                63:3-6), and recalls his Assyrian flood, reaching even to the
                neck (Isa. 8:7-8).<a id="noteref_492" name="noteref_492"

                The transition to the vision of vials is now made by a sudden
                change of theme, and a return to the world-process of
                judgment that is age-long and world-wide in its scope and
                purpose.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The vision of

            concerning the wicked, another group of seven that are set forth
            in a form similar to the judgments under the trumpets, but of
            increased severity, and that are promptly executed. They are
            called <span class="tei tei-q">“another sign”</span>, and may be
            regarded as another <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page182">[pg

            complete fulfilment of the contents of the trumpet-judgments
            presented in another way, which are given for increased emphasis
            under figures that are analogous, and that indicate their inner
            connection; and, so far as the vials have any time-relation, they
            may be regarded as belonging to the same general period as the
            trumpets, i. e. the time of man's existence on the earth,
            especially the period of conflict, though shown by their
            progressive and destructive character to culminate in the closing
            period of human history. The vials are marked by an intensity of
            form and rapidity of movement, especially as they approach the
            end, and they are not limited like the trumpets to a part of men,
            but affect all the evil. They are vivid symbolic presentations of
            deep and terrible punishments, and are called 'the last plagues'
            because in them is fulfilled or completed the wrath of God upon
            the earth—a new and final view of the divine purpose concerning
            the wicked which may be looked at quite apart from any previous
            view.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Some
            preterists, who find in the seals a prophetic description of the
            trials of the church in the first age, regard the trumpets as a
            typical presentation of the fall of Jerusalem, and the vials as a
            portrayal of the fall of Rome.<a id="noteref_493" name=

            This opinion, it is affirmed, accords best with the general
            method of the Apocalyptic writings, which have for the most part
            a definite and local interpretation, and avoids the difficulty of
            an apparent repetition of similar judgments upon the same objects
            under the trumpets and the vials. But, upon the other hand, the
            prophetic outlook of John appears to the majority of devout minds
            to have a far wider sweep than that of other Apocalyptic writers
            outside the Scriptures, and to embrace a world-view that is
            universal, and that is not at all met by these limited historical
            fulfilments. Still, even if the former view were correct in its
            main assumption, <span class="tei tei-q">“that does not preclude
            us,”</span> as has been well said,<a id="noteref_494" name=

            <span class="tei tei-q">“from interpreting the inspired words as
            referring not only to events near John's time, but also to other
            events of which they were the foretaste and figures. To us the
            meaning [in that case] is that the type of the end has been
            foretold and has come, but that <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

            foretold [the full end] must be watched for in all
            seriousness.”</span> If we have a correct view of prophecy we can
            readily assent to these words of wisdom which cannot be too
            strongly emphasized.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It should be
            noted in passing that the revelation of these world-judgments in
            the visions of the seals, the trumpets, and the vials,
            notwithstanding their separate character, may be seen to follow a
            certain line of development, showing an inner connection; and
            also, that the divine purpose of judgment may be considered as
            being in a general way partially disclosed under the seals,—for
            judgment is one phase of the seals though a subordinate one—as
            being publicly proclaimed by the trumpets, and as being fully
            executed in the pouring out of the vials, each series presenting
            a different view, complete in itself, of God's punitive
            inflictions for sin throughout the whole history of mankind. They
            are seen, also, to reflect God's long-suffering patience with the
            sinner, first making known his wrath in an order of providences
            which affect his people as well as those of the world; then in
            threatening and manifesting his purpose to punish evil by an
            order of events which affect only a part of mankind, i. e. the
            sinful because they are sinful, and that afford abundant
            opportunity for repentance; and, finally, by the swift execution
            of a divinely just though terrible punishment upon all the
            obdurately wicked that refuse to repent. This last is the great,
            impressive, and awe-inspiring thought of the vision of the
            vials.</p>

              A. The Preparation for the Vials, Ch. 15:1-8</h4>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
              preparation for the vials, which is now entered upon, is a
              connecting link with the former vision, and a prelude to the
              plagues that follow. It is introduced by an inspiring view of
              the saints who have come victorious out of the conflict
              depicted in that vision, and is intended for the comfort of
              God's people in the midst of trials to which they cannot be
              indifferent, and which in affecting the world of nature and of
              men must in some degree also affect the righteous as well,
              though delivered from their destroying power. The comfort
              afforded in trial by the promise of deliverance, an element
              which has no small share in the purpose of the <span class=

              brought out in this introductory passage before the vials have
              begun to be poured out, and is not interjected between them, as
              in the episodes that occur in the seals and trumpets—the
              episode in the vision of the vials being a warning of danger.
              The vision, too, is followed immediately by the comforting
              vision of victory beginning in the seventeenth chapter.</p>

                4. The Judgment Made Ready, Ch. 15:5-8</h5>

                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
                temple, the ναὸς or inner shrine of the tabernacle of the
                testimony (i. e. of the tabernacle of the law of God), is
                seen in heaven opened, and the seven angels who are clothed
                as priests and have charge of the plagues come out of it as
                the vindicators of that law. These are <span class=
                "tei tei-q">“arrayed with <span class=
                "tei tei-hi"><span style=
                "font-style: italic">precious</span></span> stone”</span>,
                according to the variant reading adopted in the Revised
                Version, which has the weight of manuscript authority in its
                favor; but, as this reading differs from the Authorized
                Version only by a single letter in the Greek word, and only
                yields sense by the insertion of the word <span class=
                "tei tei-q">“precious”</span>, it is best to regard it as due
                to a very early mistake of a copyist, and keep the old
                reading, <span class="tei tei-q">“clothed in linen”</span>,
                (Ezek. 9:2).<a id="noteref_498" name="noteref_498" href=
                "#note_498"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
                "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">498</span></span></a>
                The thought is in either case practically the same, viz. that
                these angels are clothed like priests, for the phrase
                <span class="tei tei-q">“arrayed with precious stone”</span>,
                if we adhere to that reading, recalls the breastplate of the
                high-priest, as the phrase <span class="tei tei-q">“clothed
                in linen”</span> evidently refers to the garments of the
                priesthood. There are seven angels in the vision to symbolize
                the universal character of the punishments, and there are
                given unto them by one of the four living creatures who
                represent all created life, seven golden vials or bowls full
                of the wrath of God (cf. Jer. 25:15f) to indicate the nature
                of their mission. <span class="tei tei-q">“And the temple was
                filled with smoke”</span>, the sign of the presence and glory
                and terror of the Lord; and, as at Sinai, no one could enter
                his presence while the judgments were being manifested.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The vials or
              bowls in the vision, which are apparently the same as the
              basons used in the temple service for receiving the sacrificial
              blood and the wine of the drink-offering, are made the symbolic
              receptacles of the judicial wrath of God against sin, called
              <span class="tei tei-q">“the wine of the fierceness of his
              wrath”</span> in verse nineteen, which is evidently conceived
              of as stored up through long periods to be suddenly and
              violently poured out. The golden bowls seem to indicate broad
              shallow vessels quite unlike our modern vials, probably of a
              deep saucer-like shape so that their contents could be poured
              out at once and suddenly.<a id="noteref_499" name="noteref_499"

              The name <span class="tei tei-q">“vials”</span> has, however,
              been retained in these notes, notwithstanding the change to
              <span class="tei tei-q">“bowls”</span> in the Revised Version,
              because of its associations and wide use in commentaries. The
              translation of φιάλας as <span class="tei tei-q">“bowls”</span>
              is doubtless more accurate, but the term used is relatively
              indifferent if the proper meaning be attached to it. They are
              not vials in the modern sense, but in the original sense of the
              word φιάλη in the Greek, which is the source of our English
              word <span class="tei tei-q">“vial”</span>, but which meant a
              shallow cup or bowl. The pouring out of the vials or bowls is
              the symbol of the execution of divine wrath upon the world. The
              vague description given in the vision of the nature of the
              inflictions which finally fall upon men as the result of the
              pouring out of the vials, forbids our attempting any very
              definite interpretation of them beyond the most general one
              that the world of nature and of men is made to abound with
              terrors which distress the evil. In this interpretation we can
              be absolutely confident, and the general effect seems to be the
              chief matter of importance. The abiding impression of the
              judgments of the vials, despite their obscurity, is one of deep
              and pervasive solemnity.</p>

                  part of the fourfold division of creation noted under the

                  fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun; and it was
                  given unto it to scorch men with fire: the symbol of wrath

                  fifth angel poured out his vial upon the throne of the
                  Beast; and his kingdom was darkened; and men gnawed their
                  tongues for pain, and blasphemed the God of heaven, and
                  they repented not of their works: the symbol of wrath
                  poured out on the throne of the Beast as the representative
                  of Satan's power in the world, thus afflicting the
                  worshippers of the Beast and his image. Under the fifth
                  vial it will be seen that the plagues pass from the
                  physical to the spiritual sphere of action, just as they
                  did in the seals and trumpets; and they are found to be
                  cumulative rather than successive, while, as under the
                  preceding vial, they do not lead to repentance but to wrath
                  and punishment. Also, throughout the vials, it is not the
                  third part only that is affected, as under the trumpets,
                  but the punishment falls upon the whole created world,
                  showing the universal character of the judgments.</p>

                  The Euphrates was the center and stronghold of heathenism

                  The whole course of the vials is toward the End, which
                  though not described, yet stands out in singular prominence
                  as the inevitable result of the ruin wrought by sin; and
                  here, as in the vision of the trumpets, the millennial
                  period is not brought into view as a preceding stage. The
                  transition to the scene of victory in the seventeenth
                  chapter is after this immediately made by one of the
                  vial-angels (ch. 17:1).</p>

                  <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If we
                  now recall the path of the seven vials, we can see how in
                  their course they rapidly and intensively press on to the
                  end of the ages and to the final ruin of the world, and
                  also how they aptly prefigure the progressive punitive
                  inflictions of God for sin. They are both world-wide in
                  their character and relentless in their execution. They
                  fall upon the land, and upon the sea, upon the rivers and
                  fountains of waters, and upon the sun the source of
                  light,—the figurative representatives of the created
                  universe. Then, like the judgments of the seals and of the
                  trumpets, they pass from the natural world to the sphere of
                  the spiritual, and are seen to fall upon the far-reaching
                  kingdom of the Beast, i. e. upon the world-powers operating
                  under Satan's direction in open hostility to the church;
                  afterward they fall upon the Euphrates, the old center of
                  heathenism and seat of spiritual darkness in the far East,
                  the typical center of the world-forces of evil; and finally
                  under the seventh vial they lead to the end of the world,
                  the conclusion of the centuries, and the day of complete
                  recompense for sin. The distinction between the kingdom of
                  the Beast, i. e. the world-powers of all time, and the
                  forces represented by the Euphrates, the center and seat of
                  heathenism, is not so clearly drawn under the fifth and
                  sixth vials, as that between Satan <span class="tei tei-pb"
                  id="page191">[pg 191]</span><a name="Pg191" id="Pg191"
                  class="tei tei-anchor"></a> with his host, and the
                  world-forces of heathenism, under the fifth and sixth
                  trumpets. But the kingdom of the Beast, here, as elsewhere,
                  evidently represents the world-kingdoms in their organized
                  form (or if taken in a narrower sense the then kingdom of
                  Rome that foreshadowed them all), which forces are
                  spiritually opposed to the kingdom of God; whereas the
                  Euphrates, the center and seat of spiritual darkness in the
                  historic past, apparently represents heathenism in the
                  great East, which is here regarded as a far-reaching
                  spiritual force operating against Christianity—the
                  judgments under these vials falling upon the world-force
                  operating in the sphere of the spiritual, and upon the
                  world-religions opposing Christianity. And no one surely
                  can read the record of the vials without being impressed
                  with the unerring certainty and absolute terror of the
                  final punishment for sin; so that even if the vision of the
                  vials did point primarily, as most preterists insist, to
                  the destruction of Rome and its temporal power, it surely
                  points yet more decisively to the great era of judgment
                  upon the powers of evil that culminates in the closing
                  period of human history. The vision depicts God punishing
                  the evil in a progressive course to the very end, and this
                  end is only effectively reached in the day of final
                  judgment.</p>

              spirits of demons,—come out of the mouths of the Dragon, the
              Beast, and the False Prophet (or Second Beast), representing
              the malign influences by which these powers of evil incite the
              kings of the earth to the great world-conflict against
              Christianity, described here under the figure of a battle of
              the war of the great day of God, the Almighty, taking place at
              Har-Magedon, i. e. either the fortified city, or the mountain
              of Megiddo, by the edge of the plain of Esdraelon, the great
              historic battle-ground of Jewish history (cf. Joel 3:2f; also
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bk.

              probably referred to because of the notable victory attained
              there over the kings of Canaan (Jg. 5:19). In this culminating
              scene of conflict we have what may be regarded as a symbolic
              view of the entire struggle between sin and holiness which is
              ever going on in the world the ages through, but more
              particularly of its triumphant ending in the last age when the
              Dragon and the kings of the earth shall be completely and
              finally overthrown;<a id="noteref_509" name="noteref_509" href=

              but beyond this partial interpretation we cannot safely go in
              any trustworthy exposition of this truly impressive figure. The
              symbol of battle and victory, it depicts the conflict of the
              centuries, and points to the assured triumph that awaits the
              people of God in the end of the world, while it incites men to
              persistent faith and hope; but like many other prophetic
              predictions, its explicit interpretation can only be definitely
              given after the events themselves have been openly
              fulfilled.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The vision of
            victory is a revelation of complete and enduring triumph in the
            final issue of the conflict between sin and righteousness,
            showing the doom of Christ's enemies, the vindication of the
            righteous, and the consummation of the ages. The vision consists
            of three parts, viz. (1) the mystic Babylon and her fall, (2) the
            triumph of the redeemed, and (3) the last things, which are seven
            in number, implying a sevenfold completeness. This triple
            division of the contents of the section before us, into a
            description of Babylon's fall, redemption's triumph, and the
            things of the end, is one that is clearly indicated in the
            thought of the text, whatever plan of division we may adopt, and
            as these all belong to the final victory in its completeness,
            they may well be presumed to constitute parts of one vision.
            Opinions differ, however, concerning the correct division of this
            part of the book almost as much as they do in regard to the
            interpretation. The division adopted here, though not coinciding
            in all its parts with any single authority, is one of the
            simplest and most natural, and it is believed will commend itself
            to the reader.<a id="noteref_510" name="noteref_510" href=

            entering upon this section it will be noted that the transition
            from the vision of vials to the vision of victory is made in the
            first verse of the seventeenth chapter by one of the seven
            vial-angels, who offers to show John the judgment of the great
            Harlot, or of Babylon, i. e. the complete and final judgment of
            the seventh vial wrought out, thus leading by a natural
            connection of thought to a fuller view of one phase of the
            judgment of the world, and through this on to victory and to the
            End.</p>

              The Mystic Babylon and Her Fall, Ch. 17:1-18:24</h4>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In these two
              chapters there is given an impressive portrayal of the sinful
              world as she lures men to evil, under the symbol of Babylon, or
              the Harlot, and of the final punishment inflicted upon her; it
              is, in fact, an elaboration of the judgment of the seventh
              vial, foreshadowing the downfall of the most insidious,
              seductive, and persistent form of the world's opposition to
              Christ and his kingdom, viz. corrupt society. This passage
              <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page194">[pg 194]</span><a name=
              "Pg194" id="Pg194" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> forms a
              subclimax of rare beauty and power, and one that is of prime
              importance in the interpretation of the book, for it contains
              one of the chief ideas of the Revelation, and necessarily
              affects our conception of the prophecy throughout. That pagan
              Rome in its social debasement and spiritual degradation was in
              the foreground of John's thought can scarcely be doubted;<a id=
              "noteref_511" name="noteref_511" href="#note_511"><span class=
              "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

              but in the light of prophetic vision it formed an ideal
              groundwork for the larger thought of the godless world, the
              world from the standpoint of its material and social forces
              adverse to God and his kingdom, the perpetual Rome. Some
              interpreters limit the meaning of Babylon to the coeval city of
              Rome, or to the nation that centered in the city, pagan Rome,
              others refer it to the Roman church, papal Rome, and still
              others to Jerusalem, the Jewish Rome, while a common
              interpretation makes it the apostate church in a fallen age, a
              prophetic Rome. But the figure is more correctly interpreted as
              the ideal and universal world-city, a symbol designed to
              include every city or community that exalts itself against the
              dominion of Christ, the perpetual Rome, the ever-recurring
              Babylon whose spirit never dies, the city being regarded as the
              highest expression of the world's social and communal
              life.<a id="noteref_512" name="noteref_512" href=

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With the
              portrayal of Babylon is completed the cycle of great
              world-forces that we find depicted in the Revelation as arrayed
              against our Lord and his Christ. The entire opposition of the
              present evil world to Christ and his kingdom is presented in
              these visions under four separate and distinct symbols,—four
              the earth-number—viz. (1) the Dragon or Satan, the World-Lord,
              the prime antagonist and representative leader of the spiritual
              forces of evil, who incites the world to resist the rule of
              Christ, the world taking its cue and color from Satan, the
              arch-enemy of all good; (2) the First Beast, the World-Power,
              the national and political forces of the world in their
              organized form opposing and persecuting Christ and the church,
              the world acting through the elements of civic and social
              order, of law and government, making them the agents
              <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page195">[pg 195]</span><a name=
              "Pg195" id="Pg195" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of persecution;
              (3) the Second Beast, the World-Religion, the national and
              racial false religious forces of the world, with their moral
              and intellectual thraldom over the minds of men, contending
              against Christianity and the kingdom, the world acting through
              the elements of the natural and ethnic religions, and of
              superstition and priestcraft their innate cogeners, permeating
              them with deceit and making them the agents of delusion and
              oppression; and (4) the Harlot Babylon, the World-City, society
              in its commercial, impure, and godless life resisting the
              progress of the kingdom, the world acting through the elements
              of the social, sexual, and commercial relations of men, making
              them the agents of sin. This fourfold form of world-opposition
              to Christ and the church is a fundamental conception of the
              Apocalypse, and lies at the core of any correct interpretation
              of the book.<a id="noteref_513" name="noteref_513" href=

              For, notwithstanding their close relation, to identify Babylon
              with the first Beast, or the second, or both, as is often done,
              is to confuse ideas that are essentially distinct, and
              measurably to miss the proper significance of the lesson
              contained. And if we fail to perceive the proper meaning of any
              part of this fourfold symbolism, we lose in some measure at
              least the complete and general effect of the whole sublime
              creation of the Apocalyptic vision.</p>

                according to the familiar method of Hebrew thought. The world
                is presented as a spiritual harlot, one that has proved
                untrue to her Lord and that merits condign punishment.</p>

                  waiting ears. The Harlot whose home is in the wilderness,
                  i. e. in this world (perhaps so called from the thought of
                  the wilderness as the place of temptation of Israel, of
                  Elijah, and of Christ, and as the haunt of demons where the
                  scapegoat was sent forth to Azazel), is definitely
                  identified with Babylon (v. 5 and 18), the great
                  World-City, the dwelling-place and representative of
                  corrupt society tempting men to evil. The great Harlot is
                  the ideal personification of the great city. There is in
                  fact a double symbolism; the great Harlot symbolizes the
                  great city, as the great city symbolizes the great world,
                  for the Harlot, the city, and the world are one and the

                  combined incarnation of commercialism, lust, and
                  irreligion,<a id="noteref_515" name="noteref_515" href=

                  The Harlot is the manifest impersonation of lust and sexual
                  impurity, a form of the world's sin that has always been
                  the source of ruin to a multitude of souls—her traffic, we
                  are told, is in the <span class="tei tei-q">“souls of
                  men”</span> (ch. 18:13). She represents the world tempting
                  men through the sexual appetite, though the figure does not
                  stop with that, as the story of the fall of her wealth and
                  the punishment of her irreligious life clearly shows. All
                  the social side of life that tends to sin is represented by
                  this impressive figure before which the Apocalyptist
                  <span class="tei tei-q">“wondered with a great
                  wonder”</span> (v. 6).</p>

                  <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
                  interpretation of the Harlot Babylon as the Roman Catholic
                  Church, a method so prevalent in the period that succeeded
                  the Reformation, is happily in its decadence, for it has no
                  justification in the text. But to find in this figure a
                  symbol and portent of apostasy prevailing in the church
                  universal that shall increase as the centuries go on,<a id=

                  is equally unfortunate and imparts a tone of pessimism to
                  the entire prophecy which cannot be too strongly
                  deprecated. No sign of apostasy is anywhere given in the
                  account of Babylon's fall, for there is no indication that
                  the Harlot was ever holy. Her sin is worldliness, impurity,
                  idolatry, and persecution of the saints. For an apostate
                  church the fitting symbol for that age would have been not
                  Babylon but Samaria, the city of the faithless Israel. And
                  we may be confidently assured that Babylon represents here
                  what it always stood for to the Hebrew mind, the typical
                  world-city, the hereditary enemy of the church from without
                  and not from within, whose harlotry is the sign of her
                  unfaithfulness to God and truth. For even though a majority
                  of Protestant interpreters until within a late period have
                  made Babylon the apostate church, following the traditional
                  opinion, it is nevertheless a mistaken view, since it is
                  based upon the Old Testament use of harlotry as a figure of
                  apostasy and idolatry in Israel, a figure assumed to be
                  identical throughout, ignoring the manifest difference in
                  its present use in connection with a heathen city. The
                  modern view that Babylon is Rome in John's day is nearer
                  correct, but is too narrow in its application. Babylon is
                  the abiding <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page198">[pg

                  <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
                  Scarlet Beast on which the Woman is seated, the color of
                  the Dragon (ch. 12:3) and the sign of the blood which it
                  has shed, is referred to as the one that <span class=
                  "tei tei-q">“was, and is not; and is about to come up out
                  of the abyss”</span> (v. 8), a description showing it to be
                  the same as the First Beast which received the deadly wound
                  that was healed (ch. 13:3), i. e. the world-power, and
                  apparently designed to place it in marked antithesis with
                  the divine designation, <span class="tei tei-q">“who is and
                  who was and who is to come,”</span> in the first chapter of
                  the book (v. 4 and 8). The enigmatical phrase <span class=
                  "tei tei-q">“was, and is not; and is about to come up out
                  of the abyss, and to go into perdition”</span>, may also
                  refer to a lull in the persecution by the world-power,
                  subsequently to be renewed and leading to its final
                  destruction as a power, though its wider reference is
                  perhaps to the persistence and reappearance of the
                  world-power after any one of its forms has been overthrown,
                  together with the certainty of its final ruin. Most
                  preterists interpret the Beast that <span class=
                  "tei tei-q">“was, and is not; and is about to come”</span>,
                  as a reference to Nero whose return was generally expected
                  (a superstitious phantasy of a <span class=
                  "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Nero
                  redivivus</span></span>), by a change of figure, the
                  emperor previously referred to as the fifth head of the
                  Beast becoming the Beast itself—a questionable
                  interpretation, apparently wrought out by a keen fancy to
                  fit the words of the prophecy, but lacking efficient
                  support in the text. The Beast in the vision carries the
                  Harlot, i. e. the world-city rests upon and is upheld by
                  the world-power, an unhallowed union in striking contrast
                  with that of the Lamb and the Bride. This symbolism
                  indicates the near relation existing between the world-city
                  and the world-power exemplified in history, the world in
                  its social and irreligious form allying itself with and
                  relying upon the persecuting world-power.</p>

                  <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It
                  should be noted here that the symbolism used in the chapter
                  before us is shown to be very wide in its application. The
                  seven heads of the Beast have first of all their proper
                  symbolic meaning of full or universal dominion, i. e.
                  dominion over this present evil world; but they are further
                  interpreted to have other and different significance. We
                  are told in verse nine that they are <span class=
                  "tei tei-q">“seven mountains”</span>, evidently in the
                  primary meaning <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page199">[pg

                  "tei tei-anchor"></a> those of the city of Rome, which was
                  seated on seven hills; but symbolizing besides this all
                  mountains and hills which are the seat of world-cities, in
                  accordance with the common apocalyptic usage of seven (cf.
                  <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

                  seven heads are also in a sense identified with the
                  <span class="tei tei-q">“many waters”</span> on which the
                  Woman sitteth (v. 15), which we are told, are <span class=

                  tongues”</span>, the many dwellers in world-cities—for she
                  spreads her power over all mountains and all waters.<a id=

                  (v. 10), the king representing the throne and all it stands
                  for, i. e. seven kingdoms, a complete number, the totality
                  of kind, all the kingdoms of the world throughout history,
                  though probably, like the seven churches, conceived of as
                  individual kingdoms which are taken as representative of
                  all.<a id="noteref_519" name="noteref_519" href=

                  Perhaps in John's thought they were Egypt, Assyria,
                  Babylonia, Persia, and Greece, the five known to him that
                  were already fallen and Rome, the one then existing—the
                  nations connected with Israel's past. The past was history,
                  but the future was seen only in outline, and John groups it
                  all under one great world-power, completing the number
                  seven, which was yet to appear. This last <span class=
                  "tei tei-q">“must continue a little while”</span>, i. e.
                  during the remaining time of the world's existence, the
                  usual sense of <span class="tei tei-q">“a little
                  while”</span> in the Revelation, a period short in
                  comparison with eternity. The Beast is also <span class=
                  "tei tei-q">“an eighth”</span>, we are told, i. e. when it
                  is regarded apart from the seven heads,<a id="noteref_520"
                  name="noteref_520" href="#note_520"><span class=

                  for the world-power may be conceived of as in itself a
                  unit, comprising all its different manifestations, and yet
                  separate from them and giving rise to them. The remark is,
                  however, parenthetic and incidental, and ought not to be
                  regarded as creating any special difficulty, for no
                  reference is anywhere else made to an eighth, and it is
                  probably introduced here simply because eight is the symbol
                  of culmination <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page200">[pg
                  200]</span><a name="Pg200" id="Pg200" class=

                  Beast is <span class="tei tei-q">“of the seven”</span> (v.
                  11), i. e. he is formed—Gr. ἐκ—<span class="tei tei-q">“out
                  of seven”</span>, or in other words the Beast <em class=
                  "tei tei-emph"><span style=
                  "font-style: italic">is</span></em> the seven kingdoms
                  regarded as a unit, the world-power as it exists in all
                  ages.<a id="noteref_521" name="noteref_521" href=

                  Also the ten horns (v. 12) which symbolize complete earthly
                  power, ten symbolizing completeness and usually applying to
                  the earthly, are representative of various subdivisions of
                  the world-power, minor kingdoms with their kings, which are
                  added to the seven heads as an additional symbol of
                  world-wide empire. These are evidently thought of as yet to
                  rise after John's day, for they are denominated
                  <span class="tei tei-q">“kings, who have received no
                  kingdom as yet, but they receive authority as kings with
                  the Beast for one hour”</span>, i. e. each one for an hour,
                  or for a time that is relatively short,<a id="noteref_522"

                  an indefinite period, the ten kingdoms reaching in this
                  case, apparently, to the end of the world—not definitely
                  ten kingdoms or kings any more than one hour is a definite
                  time limit, but rather ten, the number of completeness of
                  all the parts, representing all kings and kingdoms yet to
                  rise throughout succeeding time. <span class=
                  "tei tei-q">“It seems probable,”</span> as has been well
                  said, <span class="tei tei-q">“that John foresees that the
                  hostile world-power will not be always preëminently wielded
                  by one nation as in his time; but will be divided into many
                  parts, here represented by the number ten which is a
                  complete number and not necessarily implying only ten in
                  all. This indeed exactly describes what has really been the
                  case since St. John's time, and what, humanly speaking,
                  seems likely to continue to the end of the
                  world.”</span><a id="noteref_523" name="noteref_523" href=

                  It may, also, be pointed out that the ruin of the
                  world-city described by John has been the fate of every
                  such city known to history. Thus the ten horns would seem
                  to be identical with the seventh king or kingdom which is
                  apparently the last, the world-power divided into many
                  parts and continuing to the end of time. These divisions of
                  the world-power, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page201">[pg

                  (v. 14), shall yet under divine direction eventually
                  destroy the world-city in all lands and make her desolate
                  (v. 16 and 17), i. e. the corrupt society, centered in
                  cities, which opposes Christ and his kingdom. <span class=
                  "tei tei-q">“And the Lamb shall overcome them; for he is
                  Lord of lords and King of kings”</span>, i. e. while God is
                  seen to work through the multiple world-power, the ten
                  horns or kingdoms, and eventually to destroy the Harlot,
                  corrupt society in the world, he yet finally overcomes the
                  kingdoms of this world that war against him, and makes them
                  his own; he triumphs on the earth in the fulness of time,
                  for the kingdoms of the world, we are told, shall
                  <span class="tei tei-q">“become the kingdom of our Lord,
                  and of his Christ: and he shall reign forever and

                  14)—the promise of success for the believing. In the
                  preterist-historical view the overthrow of the great city,
                  or the Harlot, by the ten subordinate rulers or kings, the
                  ten horns, is commonly interpreted as a reference to the
                  current expectation that Eastern nations, especially the
                  Parthians, were likely to march against the city of Rome
                  and overthrow it, an application of the prophecy quite
                  possible in the minds of the generation which first
                  received it, but not reaching its deeper and essential
                  meaning, and failing of any actual realization. At this
                  point it may be not inapt to remark that the wide latitude
                  with which the symbolism of the seven heads is interpreted
                  by the angel in this chapter, is a valuable guide to the
                  general method of the Apocalypse, and should put us on our
                  guard against limiting the significance of the symbols
                  strictly to a single thought, where more than one may
                  properly be intended. At the same time this does not give
                  us the liberty of unlimited freedom, but prevents our being
                  too positive in many cases as to the exact limits of the
                  symbolism.</p>

                  <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Other
                  interpretations make the Beast the Roman Empire, and the
                  seven heads seven different forms of Roman government known
                  to history, or seven individual kings, and the ten horns
                  the various parts, subdivisions, or subordinate rulers of
                  the Empire. The current interpretation of the preterist
                  school accepts unqualifiedly the seven heads as seven kings
                  of the Roman Empire and identifies Nero with the fifth head
                  or king <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page202">[pg
                  202]</span><a name="Pg202" id="Pg202" class=

                  "tei tei-q">“fallen”</span>, i. e. is now dead, but is
                  about to be restored again, according to a wide-spread
                  expectation of that time, and to become the eighth head or
                  king. This view, though supported by many eminent
                  authorities, especially those of the later critical school,
                  involves serious difficulties. It is dependent upon the
                  earlier date of the Apocalypse, or at least this portion of
                  it, i. e. just after the death of Nero, the only time
                  fitting such a prophecy—a matter by no means assured; and
                  the prophecy, if it had this meaning, was falsified by
                  subsequent events within a generation, a contingency which
                  would necessarily have discredited the book before the
                  church, and would make its acceptance as a genuine
                  prophetic writing extremely difficult, if not impossible,
                  to account for. These considerations serve to nullify the
                  surety and positiveness with which this interpretation is
                  generally urged by its advocates, and late writers indicate
                  a healthful reaction against the view.<a id="noteref_524"

                  <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another
                  similar view makes the emperors who are intended by the
                  heads of the Beast to be (1) Augustus, (2) Tiberius, (3)
                  Caligula, (4) Claudius, (5) Nero (now <span class=
                  "tei tei-q">“fallen”</span>, or dead—Galba, Otho, and
                  Vitellius who succeeded Nero for short periods being
                  omitted as pretenders), (6) Vespasian (the one who now
                  <span class="tei tei-q">“is”</span>, i. e. now is on the
                  throne), (7) Titus (who <span class="tei tei-q">“must
                  continue a little while”</span>, i. e. have a short reign),
                  and (8) Domitian (a second Nero—<span class="tei tei-q">“an
                  eighth”</span> who <span class="tei tei-q">“is of the
                  seven”</span>). This interpretation, though quite possible
                  from one point of view, necessarily limits the vision to a
                  narrow horizon; and while, like the former view, it tends
                  to bring the teaching of the book into closer harmony with
                  Jewish Apocalyptic, yet it obscures to some extent at least
                  the wider and universal teaching which seems to the average
                  Christian mind to belong essentially to the prophetic
                  insight. It should be remembered, too, that the seven heads
                  and ten horns belong originally to the Dragon or Satan, as
                  symbols of his world-wide power, and are here transferred
                  to the Beast as Satan's representative; and therefore it is
                  more likely that they have a universal reference than that
                  they apply to a single empire, for Satan's sphere of
                  influence is confessedly world-wide (cf. ch. 13:1, note).
                  Besides it is fruitless <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
                  "page203">[pg 203]</span><a name="Pg203" id="Pg203" class=
                  "tei tei-anchor"></a> to attempt to interpret with any
                  positiveness the heads and horns as individual nations and
                  kings, as the diverse results have shown, each interpreter
                  having his own application, and no one interpretation being
                  generally accepted.<a id="noteref_525" name="noteref_525"
                  href="#note_525"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

                  But even if we cannot be so positive as to the primary
                  meaning, we should not allow the larger and more important
                  meaning to escape us, the meaning for us and for all time.
                  This is the fundamental principle of interpretation
                  according to the symbolical school, which should be kept in
                  mind throughout; and it is remarkable how often the general
                  meaning is plain when the original reference, as in this
                  case, is obscure. For even if John had primarily in mind
                  certain phases of the Roman Empire, we must not lose sight
                  of his idealization of the symbolism. The numbers seven and
                  ten are not to be interpreted literally but symbolically as
                  elsewhere throughout the book. Whatever kings and kingdoms
                  are in the first instance intended, they are introduced as
                  the type of all kings and kingdoms of this world throughout
                  all time, in accordance with the prevalent use of numbers
                  in the Apocalypse; so that in any case the chief thought
                  established is essentially the same, viz. that the
                  anti-christian world-power attains its fulness and
                  completeness under the numbers seven and ten, and then
                  wanes and is eventually destroyed. If we interpret of Rome,
                  then the ruin of the one empire with its rulers and parts
                  foreshadows that of every other earth-power that opposes
                  the rule of Christ among men, and the overthrow of the one
                  city with its social and civic forces allied with evil,
                  prefigures that of the entire anti-christian social and
                  civic power throughout the world.</p>

                mystery of the Harlot and of the Beast having been revealed,
                another angel now declares the doom which awaits them. The
                downfall of the city and the destruction of her wealth is set
                forth as the type of the overthrow of corrupt society with
                all pertaining to it, in order that the fulness of Christ's
                kingdom may be ushered in among men. In the vision of the
                prophet the ruin is viewed as already complete; attention is
                centered so fully upon the result attained that the method
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page204">[pg 204]</span><a name=
                "Pg204" id="Pg204" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> by which it is
                accomplished is left quite out of view. But the closing
                verses of the preceding chapter serve to indicate the source
                of her destruction, viz. in the ten horns, or subdivisions of
                the world-kingdom, which rise against the Harlot and
                overthrow her (ch. 17:16-17),—the historic fate of
                world-empires and world-cities in revolution and ruin. It is
                here worthy of note how clearly we find in this chapter
                reverberating echoes from Isaiah's Doom of Babylon and of
                Tyre (Isa. ch. 13:23, 47), and from Jeremiah's Doom of
                Babylon (Jer. chs. 50 and 51), as well as from Ezekiel's Doom
                of Tyre (Ezek. chs. 26-28).<a id="noteref_526" name=

                Though the fall of the heathen city of Rome was doubtless
                foremost in John's mind, let us not forget that it only
                formed the basis of the wider thought of the ultimate fate
                and fall of the great godless world which it so clearly
                foreshadowed, the foresight of which was a part of the

                  desolate.”</span> In this triple mourning of the kings of
                  the earth, of the merchants, and of the seamen, is shown
                  the wide relations of Babylon, too wide in fact for any
                  single city. The darkly shadowed terms of poetic
                  description used throughout the chapter, set forth the
                  completeness of her destruction, and are an echo from the
                  Fall of Tyre in Ezekiel's prophecy (chs. 26-28).</p>

                  or mighty angel, taking up a stone like a great millstone,
                  casts it into the sea as the sign of her total extinction,
                  and rehearses the fate of the city in the ominous words of
                  ancient prophecy, which are here enlarged and made more
                  terrible (cf. Jer. 51:61-64). The symbolism used throughout
                  this chapter, it will be noted, is largely drawn from the
                  Old Testament prophecies concerning the ancient cities of
                  Babylon and Tyre. <span class="tei tei-q">“And in her was

                  set forth the sin of the godless and unbelieving world in

                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In
                response to the heavenly summons to rejoice (ch. 18:20), a
                thrice repeated note of victory, the Hebrew <span class=
                "tei tei-q">“Hallelujah”</span>, Praise ye Jehovah! is heard
                in heaven; first from the voice of a great multitude, who say
                a second time, <span class="tei tei-q">“Hallelujah”</span>,
                and then from the four and twenty elders, the representatives
                of the redeemed church, together with the four living
                creatures, the representatives of all created life, who
                reply, <span class="tei tei-q">“Amen; Hallelujah.”</span>
                After this again, in response to a message from the throne
                (v. 5), another <span class="tei tei-q">“Hallelujah”</span>
                is heard from the voice of another multitude (v. 6-8), as the
                sound of many waters, the voice of those who are praising God
                in full and joyful chorus because he has avenged the blood of
                his servants, and who are now rejoicing with exceeding
                gladness (v. 7) because <span class="tei tei-q">“the marriage
                of the Lamb is come”</span>, i. e. the complete and final
                union of Christ with the redeemed church, for his wife, the
                church, hath made herself ready. The word <span class=
                "tei tei-q">“Hallelujah”</span> occurs four times in this
                passage, and is not found elsewhere in the New Testament: it
                should be noted, too, that it is used here, as it is chiefly
                used in the Old Testament,<a id="noteref_530" name=

                in connection with the punishment of the wicked. The first
                voice in this chorus of hallelujahs (v. 1f) is apparently
                that of the great multitude of the angelic host in heaven,
                which is responded to by the four and twenty elders, and the
                four living creatures; while the second voice (v. 6f) is that
                of the multitude of the universal church who have been
                redeemed by the blood of the Lamb. The description of the
                pure array of the Bride (v. 8), which is the symbol of her
                righteousness and is in such marked contrast with the
                clothing of the Harlot, may be an explanation added by the
                Apostle, as indicated in the text of the Revelation given in
                the preceding part of this book by including the verse in a
                parenthesis, though it was apparently regarded by the
                American Revisers as part of the words of the redeemed
                church.</p>

                directed by the angel to record a blessing upon those who are
                bidden to the marriage supper, i. e. who are invited to share
                in the nearer fellowship of the redeemed with Christ, and to
                partake of the rich and abundant spiritual food that awaits
                them in the new relations of the heavenly life—a further
                symbol of the spiritual union of the church with Christ added
                to that of the bride and the marriage, setting forth the joys
                of the heavenly life under the familiar figure of a marriage
                feast, the great social event of the East, and the popular
                type of the highest enjoyment, as well as the public
                acknowledgement of the consummation of the union. The
                marriage of the Lamb is put in vivid contrast with the
                fornication of the Harlot, in the usual method of the
                Apocalypse.</p>

                Apostle is so overwhelmed by the impression of the vision
                that he falls at the feet of the angel to worship
                him—probably the interpreting angel of the opening verse of
                the book, though some think identical with the vial-angel of
                chapter seventeen; but the worship is refused,<a id=

                because, as the angel declares, he is only a fellow-servant
                with John, and shares in <span class="tei tei-q">“the
                testimony of Jesus”</span> which <span class="tei tei-q">“is
                the spirit of prophecy”</span>. This significant phrase is

                and we find in it a key to the general interpretation, a
                principle to be applied throughout, viz. that the mysteries
                of the Old Dispensation find their only proper solution and
                fulfilment in the clearer teaching of the New. <span class=

                which gathers up into one and gives expression to the
                essential and animating thought of all prophecy. Others

              of the vision of victory now opens, which presents the final
              culmination and crisis of judgment and redemption, a rapid
              preview of the closing events of human history, a forecast of
              the triumph and completion of the gospel age. These events form
              a series of climaxes that are progressive and catastrophic, and
              usher in the final consummation of God's world-plan of the
              ages, a feature that is prominent in all apocalyptic
              writings.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is
              important for us to note afresh at this point, what should be
              apparent to our minds in the study of the book throughout, viz.
              that the element of climax, which enters so largely into the
              thought of the Revelation, belongs essentially to the mood and
              temper of Apocalyptic; and we should avoid emphasizing too much
              that which pertains chiefly to literary form and spiritual
              mood, as though it were intended to set forth the intimate
              nature of the divine method. Upon careful reflection it must
              become more and more apparent that the emphasis here laid upon
              the climactic side of the divine way of working, was only
              intended to be in proportion to the apparent hopelessness of
              the historical outlook without such manifest and repeated
              divine interpositions for human help, and was not intended to
              indicate that the chief effects to be wrought out will be
              accomplished by other than the method displayed in history,
              viz. by long periods of quiet progress and patient waiting,
              broken now and then by short and decisive periods of crisis.
              The apocalyptic writers followed the general mode of conception
              prevalent in the Old Testament, according to which <span class=
              "tei tei-q">“the final condition of men and the world is
              regarded less as the perfect issue of a gradual ethical
              advancement ... than as the result of an interposition or chain
              of interpositions on the part of God”</span>,<a id=
              "noteref_534" name="noteref_534" href="#note_534"><span class=
              "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
              "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">534</span></span></a>
              which is only one side of the truth—a view growing out of their
              idea of God as the immediate author of all movements in nature
              and history, and fitting in well with the increased emphasis
              laid upon climax in Apocalyptic. There is also a distinct
              foreshortening of the future which is very evident throughout
              <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page210">[pg 210]</span><a name=
              "Pg210" id="Pg210" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> this section,
              and this is a well known and characteristic feature of all
              prophecy. The extreme brevity with which are described and
              grouped together so many great events of the far future that so
              deeply affect the Christian hope, serves to indicate that the
              chief aim of the Revelation does not consist in fully
              manifesting these events which lie hidden in the hand of God,
              but in preparing the church for what precedes them, both of
              trial and of conflict. <span class="tei tei-q">“Like a flash of
              lightning in the darkness the vision lights up the whole line
              of God's purposes to the end”</span>; but how much of the
              actual form and manner of the events it was the divine purpose
              to disclose through this ideal and scenic presentation must
              continue to be, pending the manifestation of the events
              themselves, to some extent at least, a matter of diverse
              opinion.</p>

                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This part
                of the vision sets forth the final victory over all the
                powers of this world which is eventually to be attained by
                the supreme power of <span class="tei tei-q">“The Word of
                God”</span>, the ever conquering Christ, who is here
                described by this transcendental name for our Lord which is a
                distinctive title with the Apostle John.<a id="noteref_535"

                Beginning with a view of the triumphant Word going forth to
                conquer as under the first seal (ch. 6:2), Christ appears in
                the opened heaven riding on a white horse; he is called
                <span class="tei tei-q">“Faithful and True”</span>, and in
                righteousness he doth judge and make war. His eyes are a
                flame of fire, the type of purity and judgment; upon his head
                are many diadems, the crowns of conquered nations; he hath a
                name written which no man knoweth but himself,—evidently the
                <span class="tei tei-q">“new name”</span> of chapter three
                (v. 12) which John cannot interpret; and he is arrayed in a
                garment sprinkled with blood, the token of his redemptive
                work. The armies of heaven, which apparently include the
                redeemed, such as have already entered there, follow him
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page211">[pg 211]</span><a name=

                clothed in fine linen white and pure; out of his mouth
                proceedeth a sharp sword that with it he should smite the
                nations,<a id="noteref_537" name="noteref_537" href=

                for he shall rule them then with a rod of iron; and he
                treadeth the winepress of the wine of the fierceness of the
                wrath of God, the Almighty, thereby bringing punishment upon
                the evil. His divine right is clearly seen, for he hath on
                his garment and on his thigh (i. e. both on the garment and
                on the thigh, or else on the garment covering the thigh), a
                name written, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class=
                "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">King of
                Kings, and Lord of Lords</span></span>”</span>. And the
                Beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, are
                gathered together to make war against him that sat upon the
                horse and against his army, i. e. against Christ and his
                kingdom to attempt to overcome them. Thus with sublime
                imagery the vision leads up and on to the close of the great
                battle with the world-forces, which was briefly described
                before in chapter sixteen as occurring at Har-Magedon; the
                war is the same, the battle between the sinful world and the
                hosts of God which is ever going on through the ages to final
                victory in the end. Now, by a further view, the Beast, and
                the False Prophet (or Second Beast) who misguides the people
                in spiritual things, are seen to be taken, and they twain are
                cast alive into the lake of fire, while all their followers
                are slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse, even
                the sword which came forth out of his mouth (v. 15); and all
                the birds that fly in mid-heaven are called by an angel
                standing in the sun to feed upon their flesh, as in Ezekiel's
                prophecy of the Judgment of Gog (ch. 39:17-22), a judgment
                exceedingly repulsive to the Hebrew mind. The lake of fire is
                only a more fully developed form of the Jewish conception of
                Gehenna as a furnace of fire (Mat. 13:42, and 50). The
                symbolism here used may have been suggested to John's mind by
                the appearance of a sea or lake during the eruption of a
                volcano, a view not unfamiliar to those resident in
                Asia.<a id="noteref_538" name="noteref_538" href=

                This lake in the Revelation is the place of final punishment
                of the wicked, and is clearly distinguished from the pit of
                the abyss, the abode of Satan during the present
                world-period. Thus <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page212">[pg
                212]</span><a name="Pg212" id="Pg212" class=
                "tei tei-anchor"></a> is signified the triumphant overthrow
                of the World-Power and of the World-Religion as manifested in
                history. These together with the World-City are now broken
                and destroyed, while only the World-Lord, or Satan, remains
                to carry on the conflict, and the way is thereby prepared for
                the great millennial victory.</p>

                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This
                section is considered by many to refer to Christ's second
                coming, the Parousia, and, if that view were established, it
                would serve to support the opinion of those who hold that the
                second advent will be premillennial; but such an
                interpretation is beset with many difficulties and cannot be
                sustained by what is said in these verses. The description
                does not correspond with the account of Christ's coming again
                which is given in the Synoptic Gospels and the Epistles, nor
                with the passing foregleams of it in the preceding chapters,
                but rather with the delineation of Christ's conflict with the
                world as it is set forth in this book, which is depicted in
                its beginnings under the first seal where Christ goes forth
                conquering and to conquer, and which is now seen to pass
                through the thick of battle to the crowning of victory. For
                while the second coming is manifestly the one great objective
                event ever retained in the background of the visions,
                overshadowing and interpenetrating every part of the
                Apocalypse, yet it is at no time definitely introduced or
                particularly described; and the most accurate and impartial
                interpretation throughout is that which regards both the time
                of its occurrence and the position it occupies in relation to
                other events of the last days as nowhere revealed in the
                Apocalyptic vision. With the present author this view has
                grown through time from that of a possible solution of a much
                vexed question into a settled conviction of its
                correctness.<a id="noteref_539" name="noteref_539" href=

                And it should be seen, that with this section (ch. 19:11-21)
                in grave doubt, to say the least, concerning its application
                to the advent, if indeed it should not be regarded as
                entirely inapplicable, there is nothing definitely taught in
                the Revelation in regard to the time of Christ's second
                coming; for whatever opinion we may entertain concerning the
                time of that glorious event so dear to the Christian heart,
                we cannot regard this <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

                unless we interpolate into it a meaning which it does not

                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
                temporary destruction of Satan's power is here indicated by
                his being bound for a season; and this marks another advance
                in the triumphal march of events. An angel coming down from
                heaven with the key of the abyss, and a great chain in his
                hand, lays hold upon the Dragon, the Old Serpent, Satan, and
                binds him for a thousand years, and then shuts him up in the
                abyss, his present dwelling-place, from which he can now
                emerge at will during the period of conflict, and seals it
                over him that his power may be restrained until the end of
                that time. The binding of Satan indicates the limiting of his
                authority over the nations, with the subsequent ushering in
                of the triumph of the gospel among men, when, according to
                the announcement of the seventh trumpet, <span class=
                "tei tei-q">“The kingdom of the world is become the kingdom
                of our Lord and of his Christ”</span> (ch. 11:15), a promise
                partially fulfilled at this stage, but awaiting its complete
                fulfilment in the final consummation. The limiting of Satan's
                power is a preparatory stage to the events that follow, and
                precedes the first resurrection, as it also precedes the
                millennium.</p>

                and is marked in the Revelation by two successive stages, the
                first accompanying the triumph of the messianic kingdom, and
                the second preparatory to the final judgment. These two parts
                of the resurrection are separated in the vision by the whole
                millennial period. The first resurrection is special and
                compensative (scil. <span class="tei tei-q">“the resurrection
                out of the dead”</span>—Gr. ἐκ νεκρῶν—Phil. 3:11), consisting
                of certain <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page214">[pg
                214]</span><a name="Pg214" id="Pg214" class=
                "tei tei-anchor"></a> of the saints and martyrs who by reason
                of their enduring resistance of the forces of evil in their
                lives and deaths are adjudged worthy to attain unto this
                resurrection, viz. <span class="tei tei-q">“of them that had
                been beheaded for the testimony of Jesus, and for the word of
                God, and such as worshipped not the Beast, neither his image,
                and received not the mark upon their forehead and upon their
                hand.”</span> The first resurrection which is evidently
                limited to this particular class, and is compensative in
                character for evils endured, precedes the second or general
                resurrection by a thousand years, or the whole duration of
                the millennium, which is not a definite, numerical thousand
                years, but in accordance with the general use of numbers in
                the Apocalypse is a period of vast but indefinite length. The
                cry of the martyrs (ch. 6:9) has been heard, and they who
                have part in this resurrection shall live and reign with
                Christ throughout the whole millennial era, i. e. shall share
                in his presence and glory as a reward for their superior
                faithfulness, shall be with him where he is, evidently in
                heaven, for nothing is said of any new or different relation
                of Christ or of the saints to those who dwell upon the earth
                as now begun, or as entered upon at any time during this
                period. We are simply told that the redeemed saints shall
                live and reign with Christ, i. e. they shall enter upon the
                new and fuller life with Christ which follows the
                resurrection of the body, and they shall share in the
                triumphant rulership of Christ in heaven. The main thought in
                the phrase <span class="tei tei-q">“with Christ”</span>, it
                will be seen, is not so much that of location, as of
                association with him in messianic rule.<a id="noteref_542"

                evidently does not mean that they are to exercise the
                function of mediators for the rest of mankind during that
                intermediate period,—for no such service in heaven is
                anywhere taught in Scripture—but only that they are granted
                familiar access to and fellowship with God and Christ such as
                the priests had who drew near under the old covenant; they
                stand in his presence as the priests of old stood in the

                shall be restrained though not extinguished, and
                righteousness shall rule among men. The millennial reign of
                the saints with Christ, while Satan is limited in his sphere,
                as is indicated by his being bound with a great chain, is
                evidently intended to represent the period of the church's
                triumph. The length of time implied by the millennium is a
                period of multiple completeness which is represented by a
                thousand, the cube of ten, the symbol of a duration that is
                of great but indefinite extent, covering a long period of
                time, stretching to untold generations, during which the rule
                of Christ shall be triumphantly established upon the
                earth.<a id="noteref_543" name="noteref_543" href=

                The chief thought in the thousand years is doubtless that of
                great and enduring victory. This period, as has been
                effectively said, <span class="tei tei-q">“may well be of
                such an indefinite length as to lead to the salvation of
                unnumbered multitudes—multitudes so vast and countless that
                all the lost of all the ages will be but an infinitesimal
                fraction in comparison.”</span><a id="noteref_544" name=

                Such a view serves to lighten in a measure the dark places of
                Scripture and history with a vision of blessing and hope,
                though it cannot be said to disperse to any great extent that
                impenetrable shadow which hangs over God's purpose in the
                world's long deep night of sin and death.</p>

                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">No other
                passage in the New Testament has taken a deeper or more
                permanent hold upon the minds of believing men than this
                pregnant prophecy of a millennium, in which the thousand
                years is six times named in as many verses. Unfortunately
                interpreters have not been agreed concerning the meaning of
                the passage; in fact no part of the Word of God has, perhaps,
                been so much in dispute as these verses in the Revelation. It
                may <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page216">[pg
                216]</span><a name="Pg216" id="Pg216" class=
                "tei tei-anchor"></a> be worth while, therefore, to say that
                in the interpretation we should clearly recognize upon the
                one hand that the promise of a millennium was intended to
                create in the minds of men a pervasive hope of ultimate
                divine triumph in the world; while upon the other hand we
                should avoid making this glorious promise the groundwork of
                purely human fancy. The blessings of the millennial period
                here set forth evidently pertain both to the saints in glory
                and to the kingdom of God in this world. The particular
                nature of the reign of the saints with Christ during the
                thousand years is not revealed; but we know assuredly that
                Christ and his kingdom have prevailed upon the earth. The
                millennium manifestly presents a natural and complete
                antithesis to the long period in which the church suffered
                oppression under domination of the world-powers. The part
                allotted to the saints in the triumph of the kingdom in which
                they live and reign with Christ, is set forth in terms of
                long prevailing and deeply cherished Jewish ideals. To occupy
                <span class="tei tei-q">“thrones of judgment”</span> was part
                of the recognized hope of Israel (Ps. 122:5), and is clearly
                a human way of conceiving of superhuman relations. That this
                hope is to be realized in the final spiritual supremacy of
                God's children, specially promised to the twelve of the inner
                circle (Mat. 19:28; and Lu. 22:30), and evidently to be
                shared in a particular degree by all those who have part in
                the first resurrection, though ultimately in some measure
                also by all the redeemed, does not admit of serious doubt,
                but the exact form in which it will be realized is not made
                plain.</p>

                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">According
                to the usual premillennial view the first resurrection is
                interpreted as consisting of all believers who have died
                previous to that time, and not of those only who share in it
                by reason of special service and testimony; and the
                millennial reign of those who rise from their graves in this
                resurrection is held to be upon the earth, and is to be
                ushered in by the second coming of Christ who will establish
                a new dispensation in which he will be personally manifest,
                and will rule in the world, either from an earthly capital as
                Jerusalem, or from heaven in close communication with the
                saints.<a id="noteref_545" name="noteref_545" href=

                "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">545</span></span></a>
                This view, it will be seen, rests upon Jewish conceptions,
                and derives its support from a sternly literal interpretation
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page217">[pg 217]</span><a name=
                "Pg217" id="Pg217" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of Old
                Testament prophecies. But, notwithstanding its natural
                attractiveness to the minds of men, it fails of adequate
                confirmation in the text. Upon the other hand most of the
                symbolical school interpret the first resurrection
                figuratively, as a resurrection to spiritual life, and regard
                the millennium as now in progress. The prevalence of this
                view seems to be largely due to the early influence of
                Augustine,<a id="noteref_546" name="noteref_546" href=
                "#note_546"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

                who identified the millennium with the period of the
                Christian church on earth, and held that for those who belong
                to the true church the first resurrection is past already,
                making it the equivalent of the resurrection to spiritual
                life spoken of in John's Gospel (Jn. 5:25),—a passage which,
                though showing that a spiritual resurrection is a distinct
                Johannine conception, does not serve to break the natural
                force of these words in their present connection. The usual
                interpretation of the thousand years given by the symbolical
                school cannot be considered as satisfactory,<a id=
                "noteref_547" name="noteref_547" href=
                "#note_547"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
                "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">547</span></span></a>
                viz. that the phrase expresses a quality, i. e. completeness,
                and not a period of time; and that the meaning of the phrase
                <span class="tei tei-q">“bound him for a thousand
                years”</span> is that Satan was completely bound. The
                symbolical use of the number one thousand is evident, but
                that does not deprive it of all quantitative value, it only
                affects its literal significance; and the denial that the
                word <span class="tei tei-q">“years”</span> has any reference
                to time is without proper exegetical support and must be
                rejected.<a id="noteref_548" name="noteref_548" href=

                According to the current symbolical interpretation the entire
                passage (ch. 20:1-10) is regarded as an episode which is
                descriptive of the complete safety and spiritual deliverance
                of Christ's people throughout the whole period of the
                age-long conflict;<a id="noteref_549" name="noteref_549"
                href="#note_549"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
                "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">549</span></span></a>
                and thus the millennium as a period of triumph and
                blessedness for the saints on earth, preceding and distinct
                from the final blessedness of the world to come, fades away
                into a figure of speech, while the triumph of the gospel is
                obscured. But this view cannot be sustained except by a
                sacrifice of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page218">[pg
                218]</span><a name="Pg218" id="Pg218" class=
                "tei tei-anchor"></a> natural, if we may not certainly say
                the correct exegesis; for the paragraph will not fit a purely
                figurative interpretation.<a id="noteref_550" name=

                This view would dispose of the question of a pre- or
                post-millennial coming by denying that there is any
                millennium, in the historic sense of the term, taught in the
                Revelation. But the expedient is a fallacious one, if John
                spoke as a prophet by the inspiration of the Spirit, for his
                words incorporated the thought of his time in which the
                millennium had a definite meaning; and that he foresaw and
                described it as such is fairly evident, though he manifestly
                modified its extravagances. The idea of a triumphal period of
                the Messiah's reign is too deeply inwrought in the
                Apocalyptic literature which preceded the present Apocalypse
                to be put aside lightly as a symbol of completeness.<a id=
                "noteref_551" name="noteref_551" href=

                The duration of this time was a frequent and favorite subject
                of Jewish speculation;<a id="noteref_552" name="noteref_552"
                href="#note_552"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
                "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">552</span></span></a>
                and according to the general laws of language, the phrase
                used in the text, <span class="tei tei-q">“a thousand
                years”</span>, necessarily carries with it the conception of
                a period of time, but in accordance with the usage of the
                author, it loses its definite numerical significance and
                indicates a period of long but unmeasured duration; it
                becomes the symbol of a period that is complete.</p>

                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It will be
                recognized by the attentive student of the Word of God that
                this passage and its connections form the <span class=
                "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">crux
                interpretum</span></span> of the whole book of Revelation;
                and it is well, perhaps, not to speak with too much
                positiveness on a subject so differently understood by many
                of the most eminent scholars and interpreters. The view
                presented above seems to be the most natural meaning that can
                be given to the words of the vision, and seems also to accord
                more fully than any other with the many promises of God
                concerning the outcome of all that great and progressive
                movement among men which we call the Kingdom of Heaven in the
                earth. For without such a period of victory, the whole
                evolutionary movement in human life and history, which so
                manifestly <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page219">[pg
                219]</span><a name="Pg219" id="Pg219" class=
                "tei tei-anchor"></a> marks the purpose of God and the plan
                of redemption, would somehow seem to fail of any proper
                consummation; while in this view the millennium, marking the
                triumph of the gospel, would vindicate the present method of
                history and redemption, just as the premillennial view would
                abandon it and introduce a different order. Indeed, it may be
                well here to say, what should be clearly seen by every
                student of the Revelation, that the premillennial view
                introduces practically three dispensations into the plan of
                redemption, viz. the first, that of Moses which measurably
                failed; the second, that of Christ which is also to fail of
                complete success; and the third, that of the Holy Spirit
                which shall absolutely triumph. Whether, indeed, such a view
                is justified by what the Gospels teach and the Epistles
                indicate, is a question that each interpreter of Scripture
                must determine for himself; though it must be said that the
                large majority of Christians in all ages have not so
                understood the message of the Word. And it would certainly be
                remarkable if Christ, who was so wonderful a teacher, had
                intended to predict a premillennial coming to his own, and
                yet left it in such an indefinite form that the majority of
                earnest Christians would forever fail to apprehend it. But,
                in any case, to give up the expectation of the final
                supremacy of the gospel in the world, whether we look for it
                to be attained before or after the coming of the Lord,
                through the method of history or contrary to it, is to empty
                of its richest content the Christian hope for the world of
                men, and to contradict the deepest longing of the pious
                heart.<a id="noteref_553" name="noteref_553" href=

                of Satan's activity is permitted by divine authority, as is
                indicated by his being loosed again out of his prison, and
                seems to be of the nature of a reaction in favor of evil, a
                sequence for which we are scarcely prepared at this juncture,
                after the millennial period of Christian ascendancy. We find
                described in these verses a recrudescence of organized
                opposition to Christ and his kingdom, indicated by Satan
                coming forth again out of the abyss, according to the
                prevailing <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page220">[pg

                "tei tei-anchor"></a> method of the Apocalypse by which evil
                comes in periodic onsets. In the elucidation of the passage
                most interpreters, who regard the millennium as representing
                the triumphal period of Christ's kingdom upon earth, consider
                this incident, together with Satan's previous binding without
                the complete destruction of his power until the end when he
                is cast into the lake of fire, as showing conclusively that
                opposition to Christ has only been subdued during the
                millennial period but not extinguished, so that like a
                smouldering fire it bursts forth into flame again before the
                end.<a id="noteref_554" name="noteref_554" href=

                It can scarcely be denied that such is the underlying
                assumption of the passage, as is generally conceded, though
                the usual symbolist view, relying upon this, minimizes the
                character of the millennial triumph, and regards the
                opposition to Christ as being subdued only so far as
                believers are concerned, toward whom Satan is then completely
                bound, the millennium and the conflict going on
                simultaneously—a view that is not adequately sustained by the
                text. On the other hand the futurist view magnifies the
                nature of the millennial triumph, and leaves no reasonable
                room for this final outburst of sin; for the millennium with
                Christ dwelling among his people upon earth is heaven already
                begun, and the Scriptures nowhere teach either the
                continuance of evil after Christ's second coming, or the
                existence of an interval between Christ's coming and the
                judgment. The interpretation here given is accepted by many
                modern scholars and follows a median line, regarding the
                millennium as a period of relative triumph followed by a
                fresh outbreak of sin, as seems to be indicated in this
                passage. If we compare these verses with that strange
                apocalyptic passage in Paul's Second Epistle to the
                Thessalonians (II Thess. 2:3f.), we find that he there
                predicts a falling away from the faith and the coming of the
                Man of Sin before the advent, which seems to refer in the
                figurative language of Apocalyptic to this same period of
                final struggle preceding the end. And the Man of Sin there
                foretold may perhaps be regarded as an ideal personification
                of the sin of man then prevailing, <span class=
                "tei tei-q">“whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of
                his mouth”</span>. This last struggle is, however, only for a
                little time (v. 3), <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page221">[pg
                221]</span><a name="Pg221" id="Pg221" class=

                comparison with the millennial period, and is apparently
                permitted in order to bring about the triumphal termination
                of the conflict that Satan may be completely and forever
                overthrown and flung into the lake of fire (v. 10), the final
                place of punishment, together with the Beast and the False
                Prophet whose destruction has been already described.</p>

                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Though the
                general idea of the paragraph is relatively plain, the
                particular meaning of the prediction is involved in much
                obscurity, viz. that of a war in which Satan deceives the
                nations of the earth, Gog and Magog,<a id="noteref_555" name=
                "noteref_555" href="#note_555"><span class=

                whose number is as the sand of the sea, and who go up under
                his leadership to compass the camp of the saints and the
                beloved city, but who are destroyed by divine intervention
                through fire from heaven. The description is evidently
                symbolic, and Gog and Magog were doubtless not intended to be
                identified as particular nations; nor can the fulfilment be
                literally understood. Like many of the prophecies of the past
                it is surrounded by a haze of indefiniteness that prevents
                its full interpretation until its meaning is revealed by the
                course of events. The source of the symbolism is found in the
                Old Testament invasion of Gog, a passage in Ezekiel (ch.
                38-39), a prophetic scene of war, which becomes here the
                formal type of the last struggle between the hosts of sin and
                those of righteousness, and seems to refer to some new,
                national, and world-wide form of opposition to Christ and his
                kingdom in which all the earth-forces of evil are gathered
                together for their extinction—a final stage of the conflict
                necessary for the completeness of the victory, which is to be
                postmillennial, and in which all the powers of evil shall be
                speedily and finally overthrown.<a id="noteref_556" name=

                6 The Second Resurrection, Ch. 20:11-12a, and 13a</h5>

                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This is
                the final and complete resurrection which occurs at the end
                of the world, and comprises all those, whether believers or
                not, who failed to participate in the first resurrection. The
                completeness of this resurrection is specially emphasized.
                Even the sea gave up the bodies of the dead that were in it;
                and death and Hades gave up the souls of the dead that were
                in them (v. 13a), in preparation for the judgment. The
                description here given of the second or general resurrection,
                it will be seen, presents the ordinary view of Scripture,
                while that of the first resurrection introduces a new and
                different conception, viz. that of a special resurrection.
                The main distinction between the two resurrections may be
                regarded as chiefly one of order rather than time, though the
                precedence of the first in point of time is also included. In
                each case a resurrection of the body is meant, but the first
                is partial in extent, consisting of a particular class, while
                the second is universal, comprising all classes.<a id=
                "noteref_557" name="noteref_557" href=
                "#note_557"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
                "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">557</span></span></a>
                The paragraph, when thus interpreted, affords a clearer view
                of the resurrection as a whole, showing its proper order or
                sequence, and separating into two main parts that which is
                mostly regarded in the New Testament in its entirety as a
                single event occurring at the last day. In fact the doctrine
                of two resurrections taught in this passage, and the
                clearness with which the resurrection of the wicked for
                judgment is set forth, together constitute the most notable
                contribution of the Apocalypse to the eschatology of the New
                Testament;<a id="noteref_558" name="noteref_558" href=
                "#note_558"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
                "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">558</span></span></a>
                for <span class="tei tei-q">“whatever may be the difficulties
                involved, and however they may be solved, we must recognize
                that John here predicts an anticipative and limited
                resurrection of the same character <span class="tei tei-pb"
                id="page223">[pg 223]</span><a name="Pg223" id="Pg223" class=
                "tei tei-anchor"></a> as the general resurrection which is to
                follow.”</span><a id="noteref_559" name="noteref_559" href=
                "#note_559"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
                "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">559</span></span></a>
                This was undoubtedly the thought presented to John's mind in
                the vision, whether we attach any didactive significance to
                it or not, and it ought not to be overlooked in our
                interpretation.</p>

                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At this
                point it may be not amiss to say, what must be apparent to
                every careful student of Scripture, that it was not the
                divine purpose in the book of Revelation to reveal the
                intimate nature or detail of the great events which lie at
                the close of man's history on the earth; but rather to give a
                general outline of the divine order, which would serve to
                invigorate our faith and stimulate our hope in the onward
                path of Christian duty. And while it is for the most part
                fruitless to inquire particularly concerning that which is
                not clearly revealed, at the same time the general bearing of
                this passage should not be allowed to escape our attention,
                for it is one of the most significant in the book of
                Revelation, and we may well pause a moment to consider its
                proper meaning. We have here, apparently,—if one may offer an
                opinion on so obscure a subject,—a hint that the resurrection
                which has just been described as occurring in two periods,
                first and second, is to be regarded as a <em class=
                "tei tei-emph"><span style=
                "font-style: italic">process</span></em> rather than as an
                <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
                "font-style: italic">event</span></em> that is single and
                separate in itself, one which in its entirety covers a long
                period of time, and is to be accomplished in progressive
                stages in which the righteous share first according to their
                relative worth—a process which is apparently marked by two
                principal periods that are specially in mind in the
                description before us. In the light of this view it may be
                well to recall some of the events in the Scripture record
                which seem to support it. The translation of Enoch and Elijah
                in the Old Testament, the equivalent of an immediate
                resurrection, which anticipated the victory of Christ over
                death, would otherwise be an unexplained anomaly. But
                according to this interpretation it forms a part of the
                divine order; their resurrection was not anomalous; it was
                only one step in the ever progressive plan of the ages. The
                mysterious hiding, too, of Moses' grave <span class=
                "tei tei-pb" id="page224">[pg 224]</span><a name="Pg224" id=
                "Pg224" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> in the valley of the land
                of Moab, finds an adequate explanation if he was subsequently
                translated when the divine purpose in his burial was
                accomplished—the burial vindicating the divine honor, while
                his resurrection was immediate and triumphant. The record,
                also, in the closing chapter of Daniel (Dan. 12:1-3) though
                obscure, points to a stage in the resurrection in which not
                all but many shall rise, and includes as well those who rise
                to shame and everlasting contempt, though no indication of
                the time when this will occur is given by the prophet. But
                more particularly in Matthew's account of the crucifixion of
                our Lord (Mat. 27:52-3), we find that his death was followed
                not only by the rending of the veil in the temple, indicating
                the departure of the divine glory, but that <span class=
                "tei tei-q">“the tombs were opened, and many bodies of the
                saints which had fallen asleep were raised, and coming forth
                out of the tombs after his resurrection, they entered into
                the holy city and appeared unto many.”</span> It is a weak
                exegesis that interprets their resurrection as merely
                spectral, or as only temporary and transient, even though it
                were for the purpose of witnessing to the divinity of our
                Lord. The natural meaning is that they arose as a part of the
                victory of Christ, and were ready to enter with him into the
                rest that remaineth for the people of God. These passages all
                seem to point to a progressive resurrection that is to be
                accomplished in successive stages, and they cannot well be
                otherwise interpreted except by indirection. It is true that
                the subject is only incidentally touched upon in the New
                Testament, yet it seems to be here clearly implied that
                precedence in resurrection is divinely accorded to those who
                are prepared for it, as a part of the reward of
                righteousness, and that this belongs to the divine
                order.<a id="noteref_560" name="noteref_560" href=
                "#note_560"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
                "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">560</span></span></a>
                Beyond this we cannot safely go, for it is not well to be too
                confident in maintaining any view that depends so largely
                upon the interpretation of single passages, even though the
                inference, as in this case, seems to be natural and
                conclusive.</p>

            (A Vision of Triumph). Ch. 21:1-22:5</span></h3>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The vision of
            the New Jerusalem is a crowning picture of redemption
            consummated, a vision of triumph and peace after the conflict is
            over and the victory won, portraying the eternal bliss of the
            redeemed in the immediate presence of God, whose glory is
            realized in the intimate fellowship and ultimate well-being of
            his creatures that have been finally recovered from sin and fully
            confirmed in righteousness. In this closing vision of the
            Revelation we reach the goal of Christian hope in the future life
            with God. Some future-historical interpreters have, however,
            regarded this section as describing the millennial glory upon
            earth, preceding the final consummation of all things; but the
            view is involved in so many difficulties that relatively few have
            accepted it. On the contrary the Christian mind of all ages has
            instinctively found in the vision a perspective view of the
            heavenly glory, an opinion that it may be confidently said is not
            a mistaken one.<a id="noteref_564" name="noteref_564" href=
            "#note_564"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">564</span></span></a> The
            New Jerusalem presents the resultant condition of victory
            following the long struggle against sin, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“the world to come”</span> already ushered in, which
            lies beyond the millennium and the resurrection. At this point it
            may be well to call attention to the fact that the millennium in
            Hebrew thought is the culmination of <span class="tei tei-q">“the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">age</span></span> to come”</span>, i. e. the
            age which is the triumphing period of the Messiah upon earth;
            whereas the New Jerusalem is the realization of <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">world</span></span> to come”</span>, i. e.
            of the world that is future and eternal. These ideas were quite
            distinct in Jewish thought, and they ought also to be distinct
            with us. The wonderful account of the new heaven and the new
            earth speaks of other conditions than those of the present time;
            and the view of the glorious city in this closing vision (ch.
            21:2-22:5) is aptly divisible into eight parts, the symbol of
            culmination, or of a new life or period begun, the division
            indicated in the comments that follow.</p>

              <span class="tei tei-q">“for the first heaven and the first

              This idea, which coincides with that of Paul in the Epistle to
              the Romans (ch. 8:19-23), is not, however, further developed,
              but the view turns at once to the heavenly city, for the vision
              has its proper center in the city, and is designed to present a
              view of redeemed humanity in the presence of God to which that
              of the redeemed creation is merely incidental.</p>

                herself, the Bride of Christ, the inhabitants being thought
                of to the exclusion of all else. The great city, the holy
                Jerusalem, is seen coming down out of heaven from God,<a id=

                as a bride adorned for her husband on her marriage day,—a
                figure of the intimate and tender relation of Christ with his
                people in the final state of the blessed. The city in these
                verses (9-10) is manifestly the symbol of the church that
                dwells within it; but the view that makes the New Jerusalem
                the symbol solely of the redeemed church, not only here but
                throughout the entire passage,<a id="noteref_570" name=

                of place and local surroundings in the general description of
                the city undoubtedly stands first in the Apocalyptist's
                thought, and would seldom be questioned by the ordinary
                reader, though it includes also the inhabitants as well, and
                may be used for the inhabitants alone, as is done in this
                part of the passage, without invalidating the general
                meaning. In the ninth verse, with the announcement of the
                angel, <span class="tei tei-q">“Come hither, I will show thee
                the bride, the wife of the Lamb”</span>, the account in verse
                second is resumed, and is wrought out in detail. One of the
                vial-angels carries John away in the Spirit into a mountain
                great and high that he may see the vision more fully, an
                indication of its importance.</p>

                mingled symbols of brilliancy, glory, costliness, and beauty.
                The city lies foursquare, a perfect figure, the distinctive
                number of the earthly creation still, though new, with twelve
                foundations, gates, and angels, the church number, reflecting
                the number of the tribes of Israel and of the apostles of the
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page230">[pg 230]</span><a name=

                the church number multiplied by a thousand, and the number of
                the sealed in each tribe (ch. 7:5f.),—pertinent symbols, all
                of these, of the perfect home of the redeemed, as well as of
                the symmetry of the perfect church. The city is further
                described as a perfect cube like the holy of holies in the
                sanctuary, the length and breadth and the height of it being
                equal (v. 16) which perhaps means that in the height is
                included the eminence on which it stands, though others think
                that there is an intentional absence of all
                verisimilitude.<a id="noteref_576" name="noteref_576" href=

                The symbolical meaning of the cubical dimensions is evidently
                that of a symmetrical and ideal perfection which is
                proportional in all its parts, and like to the holy of holies

                The circuit of the walls is forty-eight thousand stadia, i.
                e. four times twelve thousand furlongs or stadia, and seems
                to be a designed reference to the city of Babylon, the
                greatest city of the ancient world, the circuit of which was
                four hundred and eighty stadia, i. e. four times one hundred
                and twenty furlongs or stadia, while that of the New
                Jerusalem is greater a hundredfold, which is evidently the

                The city which is first seen from afar, coming down out of
                heaven (v. 11-14), is afterward measured, and its glories
                pointed out by the angel (see the divisions indicated by

                crying, nor pain any more (v. 4); no separate temple or inner
                sanctuary of partial access to God, for the city is all
                temple, and God forever dwells among his people (v. 22); no
                sun, nor moon, nor night, for the Lamb is the light thereof,

                Christ is throned as victor (v. 27, and ch. 22:3). In this

                also the elders, and the four living creatures, and all that

                removed the curse. The word tree is in the singular, but the
                context shows that it is to be understood generically, i. e.
                a tree of life which is found on this side of the river and
                on that, or trees of life growing by the river-side.<a id=

                Whether, indeed, God in his essential being can ever be
                directly apprehended by the finite spirit, is a question that
                with our present light we cannot definitely determine. It may
                well be in eternity as in time, there as well as here, that
                for us to see the Son is to see the Father, and that the
                beatific vision for which men have so often longed and hoped
                and prayed in the past, is to be realized in a way quite
                different from the common thought, by the blessed vision of
                the glorified and exalted Christ in the fadeless life of the
                perfected kingdom of God in heaven. The name which shall be
                upon the foreheads of the redeemed is evidently the
                <span class="tei tei-q">“new name”</span> of chapter three
                (v. 12) which sums up in itself all the fulness of the future
                revelation of God to the glorified, the transcendental and
                ineffable name to men upon earth <span class=
                "tei tei-q">“which no one knoweth but he that receiveth
                it”</span>, i. e. in the future life of the heavenly
                kingdom.</p>

                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is
                surely worthy of our attention here to note in closing, how
                all God's revelations of himself have not only tended to grow
                in intensity and clearness, but also to center in the name by
                which he is made known. Beginning with the announcement of
                his sacred name <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page233">[pg
                233]</span><a name="Pg233" id="Pg233" class=
                "tei tei-anchor"></a> Jehovah, as distinct from his former
                name Elohim, in connection with the great events of Israel's
                redemptive history, there is a manifest movement in the
                historical self-revelation of God to men that is marked by
                progressive steps which lead on through all the promise and
                mystery of the incarnate Christ to this final revelation of
                himself, lying beyond history, that shall be made to the
                redeemed under the <span class="tei tei-q">“new name”</span>
                when redemption is complete. He who was first promised to
                men, to be born <span class="tei tei-q">“of the seed of the
                woman”</span>, and <span class="tei tei-q">“of the seed of
                Abraham”</span>, and was afterward more clearly revealed to
                Israel as <span class="tei tei-q">“the son of David”</span>,
                <span class="tei tei-q">“the servant of Jehovah”</span>,
                <span class="tei tei-q">“Immanuel”</span>, <span class=
                "tei tei-q">“the Son of Man”</span>, and <span class=
                "tei tei-q">“the Messiah”</span>, and who was made known to
                men in his incarnation as <span class=
                "tei tei-q">“Jesus”</span>, <span class="tei tei-q">“the
                Christ”</span>, and <span class="tei tei-q">“our
                Lord”</span>, was finally recognized by the church under his
                full redemptive title as <span class="tei tei-q">“the Lord
                Jesus Christ”</span>, by which name he shall be known
                throughout all the centuries to the end of time. But the
                vision of the city of God reaches far beyond this, and tells
                of his name to be then written upon the foreheads of the
                redeemed, manifestly his <span class="tei tei-q">“own new
                name”</span> (ch. 3:12) that is to be revealed to the
                glorified when redemption is complete, which stands for the
                full, final, and complete revelation of God in Christ in the
                new relations of the great future life in heaven.</p>

                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus, with
                the redeemed enthroned in power, and dwelling in the unveiled
                presence of God revealed, there is completely fulfilled the
                ultimate divine purpose of man's creation and redemption.
                This, in John's view, is the consummation of all things,
                that</p>

              The opposite direction, it will be noticed, was given
              concerning the Book of Daniel (ch. 12:4, 9), which was
              commanded to be <span class="tei tei-q">“shut up and sealed

              previously explained, <span class="tei tei-q">“it belongeth to
              many days to come”</span> (Dan. 8:26). But this book is to be
              given at once to men, an evident indication that its contents
              were not regarded as secret or veiled, but were intended to be
              read and understood by all.</p>

              have hitherto been used separately (chs. 1:8, 17; 2:8; 21:6),
              but are now massed together in impressive solemnity. It is the
              equivalent of saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“I am the Source,
              and through me will be the Consummation, of all that which is

              contrast with these that are blessed, are all the wicked of
              every class who are left without, including <span class=
              "tei tei-q">“every one that loveth and maketh a lie”</span>. He
              who sent his angel to testify to these things is Jesus (v. 16),
              once born of the family of David, the bright and morning star,
              the glorious harbinger of the day of redemption.<a id=

              The words are in the form of direct address, and are
              undoubtedly from Christ himself, though as there is no apparent
              indication of a change of speaker from verse six, where the
              voice is clearly that of the angel, we may regard them either
              as given by the angel who repeats what Christ has said, or as
              personally spoken by Christ himself.<a id="noteref_589" name=

              It is well for us at this point to remember the interesting
              fact, generally known by students of the Greek Testament, that
              in verse sixteen, <span class="tei tei-q">“at the word
              <span class="tei tei-q">‘David’</span>, the manuscript 1, from
              which Erasmus compiled the Textus Receptus, ends. In order to
              supply the remainder, which is deficient, Erasmus retranslated
              the Vulgate Version into Greek. The Greek, therefore, of the
              Textus Receptus from this point onwards is the Greek of
              Erasmus”</span>,<a id="noteref_590" name="noteref_590" href=

              come to Christ for the free gift of life eternal, is fervently
              uttered before the book is closed forever. The beloved disciple
              with ardent zeal sends out this final call to the unsaved, and
              thus the message of judgment throughout the book reaches a
              fitting close in a full, free, and urgent invitation to all men
              of every class to accept the offer of salvation. This certainly
              appears to be the natural meaning of the passage, as is made
              clear by the appeal in the latter part of the verse, which
              would otherwise lack coherence, viz. <span class=
              "tei tei-q">“And he that is athirst let him come: he that will,
              let him take of the water of life freely.”</span> The verse is,
              however, regarded by many as belonging to the words of Christ
              just preceding (v. 12-16), though it is more likely, but we
              cannot say certainly, spoken by John. Either connection is
              possible, and does not materially affect the sense. Another,
              perhaps the more common though less likely interpretation,
              makes the word <span class="tei tei-q">“Come”</span>, repeated
              in the first half of the verse, a call to Christ to come again,
              referring to his promise in the twelfth verse; and regards the
              passage either as the words of Christ affirming the witness of
              the Spirit and the Bride who entreat him to come, or as an
              answering cry from John on behalf of the church.<a id=

            blessing of the human author of the Apocalypse is added as a

            benediction, though unusual in apocalypses, is here no doubt
            added because the book was intended to be read in the churches.
            And thus in words familiar to every believer is brought to a
            close the great Apocalyptic writing of the Christian church, the
            last message of the glorified Christ to his faithful disciples

            present, and the future, beheld in the light of Apocalyptic
            vision. Moved by its manifold lessons of faith and hope, we

          the book; while the Symbolical School, for the most part, does not
          regard any of them as either distinctly indicated, or certainly
          implied. It is fortunate, however, that the main teaching is not
          materially affected by the view we may take concerning these

        Numbers</span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(A Key to
        Scripture Interpretation)</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The value of the
        symbolism of numbers in the general interpretation of Scripture is
        variously estimated, but its importance in interpreting the
        Revelation is almost universally conceded, for without it we cannot
        understand aright the symbolic teaching of the book. The attentive
        student will not fail to notice the wide use of numbers throughout,
        and the effect of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and
        division, upon the symbolism of the simpler numbers. The author
        believes that a cautious use can often be made of numbers in the
        interpretation not only of the Revelation where their use is so
        manifest, but of many other parts of Scripture, if not too much
        stress be laid on the symbolic meaning, for the Hebrew mind delighted
        itself in symbols. The value of this knowledge lies in the fact that
        an additional thought may often be caught in this way that would
        otherwise escape our attention, though it is usually subordinate and
        does not occupy so prominent a place as in the Revelation. The
        symbolism of the numbers used in the book is concisely stated in this
        appendix for the convenience of the reader.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">One</span></span>
        (a unit), the Primary Number. The symbol of that which is single,
        alone, or representative. One hour, and one day, in the Revelation
        stand for a relatively short time, and a half-hour for a clearly
        limited period, even though these may not be actually short from the
        human point of view. The fractions one-half, one-third, and
        one-fourth do not represent definite parts, but in a general way
        portions less than the whole, that which is of limited extent in
        relation to the whole.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Two</span></span>
        (a pair), the Lowest Plural Number. The symbol of confirmation, of
        added strength and surety, especially the number of confirmation in
        witness-bearing. The Two Witnesses in chapter eleven, and the Two
        Beasts in chapter thirteen, it will be seen, serve to strengthen each
        other.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">Three</span></span> (a triad), the Divine
        Number. The symbol of the Trinity; of the spiritual as contrasted
        with the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page247">[pg
        247]</span><a name="Pg247" id="Pg247" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        material; of blessing in the Old Testament. A small total that is
        deemed sufficient; a limited plurality; spiritual completeness. The
        smallest number with a beginning, a middle, and an end—a fact that
        impressed the Jewish mind.</p>

        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Three and
        one-half</span></span> (one-half of seven), a Broken Number, the half
        of the Perfect Number. The symbol of the finite or undetermined; a
        broken and uncertain period without a fixed limit; a shortened period
        of time when applied to duration, and usually one of tribulation; a
        period of trial and judgment. Three and a half years is the period of
        the church's conflict in the Revelation, the age of the church
        militant, the church-eon; and three and a half days is the short and
        indefinite period of world-triumph in which the church suffers
        oppression—the equivalent of the half-week in Daniel. Three and a
        half years, the period of drought in Elijah's time, of the little
        horn in Daniel, and of Christ's public ministry, is introduced four
        times in the Revelation, viz. it is the period of the Two Witnesses
        (ch. 11:3), of the Woman in the wilderness (ch. 12:6, 14), of the
        Dragon's rage (ch. 12:14), and of the power of the Beast (ch. 13:5),
        each of which is a time of tribulation.</p>

        sides of a square), the Earth Number. The symbol of the physical
        creation, having relation to this present world which is usually
        thought of as evil; also used of world-wideness, universality of
        extent, as all parts of the earth without any moral significance.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Six</span></span>
        (one less than seven; and one-half of twelve), an Imperfect Number.
        The symbol of evil, of incompleteness of quality, or of imperfection;
        Satan's number, the signature of non-perfection; the representative
        of that which is earthly as opposed to that which is heavenly;
        falling short of the fulness of seven, the perfect number, and but
        the half of twelve, the church number.</p><span class="tei tei-pb"

        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">Seven</span></span> (the number of days in
        a week; also four plus three), the Perfect Number. The symbol of
        perfection, or completeness of quality; of totality of kind, fulness,
        or universality. A sacred number with the Jews; the number of the
        covenant in the Old Testament; the ethical number, for it often has a
        moral significance, and, as will be seen, is composed of the earth
        number (four) added to the divine number (three). The number seven
        occurs <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">fifty-four</span></span> times in the
        Revelation, indicating that it occupied an important place in the
        mind of the writer, and should receive special attention.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">Eight</span></span> (seven plus one), a

        a new life or period begun.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Ten</span></span>
        (the ten digits; the ten commandments), the Complete Number. The
        symbol of completeness of all the parts, of totality of portions,
        entirety, and absoluteness; a finite number as contrasted with
        infinity; in its larger multiples implying indefiniteness and
        magnitude. Ordinarily used of things that are earthly, though not
        necessarily implying any moral significance. It is a relevant fact,
        however, that nothing which is described in heaven is ten in number,
        though its multiples are constantly introduced. The combination of
        seven with ten in the seven heads and ten horns of the Dragon and the
        Beast, is unusual and has an evil significance throughout, which is
        probably intended to indicate that that which was originally designed
        for moral perfection (seven) has been prostituted for earthly ends
        (ten), as is signified by joining one to the other.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">Twelve</span></span> (the twelve sons of
        Jacob; four multiplied by three), the National Number of Israel. The
        symbol of the covenant nation, the church number—the number of the
        earth (four) multiplied by the number of the divine (three) becoming
        the sign of God's people divinely chosen out of the earth. By some it
        is interpreted as the number of world-witness for divine truth, as
        the twelve tribes and the twelve apostles, putting the purpose of the
        church first.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">Twenty-four</span></span> (twelve
        multiplied by two), the National Number Doubled. The symbol in the
        Revelation of the church of both Dispensations united, the Jewish and
        Christian, the church of all the ages. The glorified <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page249">[pg 249]</span><a name="Pg249" id="Pg249"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> church in heaven is ideally represented
        by the four and twenty elders that are before the throne, i. e. the
        elders represent one phase of that life.</p>

        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">Forty</span></span> (ten multiplied by
        four), the Probational Number. The symbol of temptation, or of the
        power of the earthly; often connected with the divine test of
        character, the earth number (four) multiplied by the complete number
        (ten) signifying the complete power of the earthly which is ever
        testing men. Also, as forty years was regarded as the period of
        intellectual maturity in man, it sometimes stood for a full period, a
        complete epoch, especially a complete period of stress or trial.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">Forty-two</span></span> (twelve multiplied
        by three and a half; or seven multiplied by six), a Broken Number.
        The symbol of the church-historic period of trial, the world-age, the
        duration of the rule of wickedness. Three and a half years in
        months,—the source from which this number is derived in the
        Revelation,—serves to indicate the incomplete period of the church
        (twelve multiplied by three and a half), and also the full or
        complete period of evil (six multiplied by seven).</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">Seventy</span></span> (ten multiplied by
        seven), the Cosmopolitan Number. The symbol of world-wideness; of a
        two-fold completeness that is all embracing and comprehensive,
        comprising both seven and ten; the number of the nations. [The
        numbers forty and seventy, strange to say, do not occur in the
        Revelation, though forty is common in the Old Testament, and occurs
        also in the New, and the square of forty (1600) is found in chapter
        fourteen (v. 20); seventy also had a well-known meaning to the Hebrew
        mind, especially from the period of the Captivity which lasted
        seventy years, and was also the number of disciples sent forth by our
        Lord for wider service during his Perean ministry. It is quite
        probable, however, that these numbers are not used in the Revelation,
        where so much stress is laid on the symbolism of numbers, simply
        because their symbolism was not needed, just as one hundred is not
        used except in combination with other numbers].</p>

        "tei tei-pb" id="page250">[pg 250]</span><a name="Pg250" id="Pg250"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of a multiple completeness that is
        usually applied to the earthly.</p>

        Forty-four</span></span> (twelve multiplied by twelve), the National
        Number of Israel Squared. The symbol of the completeness of the
        redeemed church—the multiplying of a number by itself conveying the
        idea of a multiple fulness or completeness; Israel, God's people,
        made complete.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Six Hundred and
        Sixty-six (six hundred, plus sixty, plus six), the Number of the
        Beast. The symbol of the threefold form of the world's evil which
        culminates in the Second Beast. Six, the number of imperfection (one
        short of the mystic seven), thrice repeated, six, six, six, (666),
        represents the combined force of the Dragon, the First Beast, and the
        Second; or, differently stated, six hundred may be taken as the
        symbol of the Dragon, sixty as the symbol of the First Beast, and six
        as the symbol of the second, which gives a total of six hundred, and
        sixty, and six, representing the combined power of evil incarnated in
        the Second Beast. In this symbolism there may also be included the
        thought of a triune power in antagonism to the divine Trinity—a
        trinity of sin.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">One
        Thousand</span></span> (ten multiplied by ten multiplied by ten), the
        Cube of Ten. The symbol of multi-completeness; a number that is great
        but indefinite in its symbolism, and often used of the heavenly. The
        thousand years of chapter twenty is a great period of time of unknown
        length, stretching out to untold generations, the millennium of the
        church's history, the period of the church's triumph and victory.</p>

        and Sixty</span></span> (forty-two multiplied by thirty; or twelve
        multiplied by three and a half and this again by thirty), the Time
        Number. The symbol of the indefinite period of present-world
        duration; the age of persecution. Twelve hundred and sixty days are
        equivalent to forty-two months of thirty days each, or three and a
        half years of three hundred and sixty days each, the symbol of the
        incomplete period of trial during which the church suffers
        oppression. To this may perhaps be added the combination of twelve
        multiplied by five, representing the incompleteness of the church as
        one factor, and seven multiplied by three, representing <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page251">[pg 251]</span><a name="Pg251" id="Pg251"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the completeness of the divine as the
        other factor, these multiplied together equalling twelve hundred and
        sixty and symbolizing God working out perfect results through the
        incomplete period of the church.</p>

        Hundred</span></span> (forty multiplied by forty; or one hundred
        multiplied by sixteen), the Square of Forty; or the Square of Ten
        multiplied by the Square of Four. The symbol of that which is
        coextensive with the created world. Forty is composed of four, the
        earth number, multiplied by ten, the number of completeness; and
        sixteen hundred, the square of forty, is the sign of completeness so
        far as this world is concerned. The square of four multiplied by the
        square of ten gives the same result, and conveys the same idea of
        world-completeness.</p>

        saved out of Israel from each tribe; or, as others interpret it, the
        complete number saved out of all the nations, included here under the
        twelve tribes, twelve thousand from each tribe; also the measure of

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Apocalyptic
        Literature is a characteristic product of Jewish national and
        religious thought. It was a favorite literary method of a particular
        age, and was born of a travail of soul which strove to find
        expression for those new currents of thought and feeling that came to
        the surface in later Judaism. Following the decadence of prophecy it
        belonged to the period of Jewish oppression, and voiced the heart-cry
        of a people true to God in the midst of national distress. Though
        anticipated in fragmentary parts of earlier prophecies, as in Ezekiel
        and Zechariah, the style of Apocalyptic first found definite form in
        the book of Daniel, which became the type of all subsequent Writings
        of this class that flourished so abundantly in the two centuries
        preceding and the century following the beginning of the Christian
        era. Couched in language that is characteristically figurative and
        symbolical the literary form is at once marked and significant, and
        reached its highest development in the canonical Apocalypse which has
        given name to the whole class. The essential limitations of this
        class of literature are clearly recognizable; its ideas move within a
        narrow range, its point of view is sombre and unequal, and its center
        of interest is mainly eschatological. It occupies a sphere peculiarly
        its own, a world of pious and often fantastic dreams—<span class=
        "tei tei-q">“for prophecy as it lost its footing on the solid earth
        took refuge in the clouds”</span>;<a id="noteref_596" name=
        "noteref_596" href="#note_596"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">596</span></span></a> it
        wrote the word mystery large across its page, and revelled in the
        weird and shadowy; but beneath its peculiar phantasy lay a profound
        religious motive—it sought to stay the troubled souls of men in time
        of storm, and in its deeper purpose strove to reconcile the
        righteousness of God with the sufferings of his people. In the form
        of strange and sometimes even grotesque symbolic visions—thought
        couched in symbols burning and vivid, which no other figure of speech
        could so well convey—and under the name of some hero of the past, it
        sketched in <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page255">[pg
        255]</span><a name="Pg255" id="Pg255" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        outline a history of the world, the origin of evil, the future
        victory of righteousness, and the final consummation of all things
        through which alone, according to the Apocalyptic view, the
        providential rule of God could be vindicated.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There still exists
        a not inconsiderable remnant of this very interesting literature,
        though the greater portion has perished in the wreckage of time. The
        principal books still extant are the <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Apocalypse of
        Baruch</span></span>; the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Ethiopic</span></span> and <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Slavonic Books of
        Enoch</span></span>; the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Ascension of Isaiah</span></span>; the
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Book of
        Jubilees</span></span>; the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Assumption of Moses</span></span>; the
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Testaments
        of the XII Patriarchs</span></span>; <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Second
        Esdras</span></span> (known also as <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Fourth
        Ezra</span></span>); the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Psalms of Solomon</span></span>; and the
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sibylline
        Oracles</span></span>. The late recovery of some of these from
        apparent oblivion is a matter of history, and their recension and
        translation by European and American scholars is not without interest
        to the general student. The study of this literature as a distinct
        class is one of the notable contributions to knowledge by the modern
        critical school. These Jewish Apocalypses were widely read in their
        day, and they both partook of and leavened the thought of their time,
        for they incorporated and expressed the current mysterious hopes and
        beliefs of the people. Their influence is distinctly traceable in the
        diction of the New Testament, and the <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Book of
        Enoch</span></span> is obviously quoted in the Epistle of Jude. These
        works ranked very high with the primitive Christians, and this led to
        their being reedited by early Christian writers, and, it is generally
        thought, to the interpolation of later ideas. There is, however, a
        very wide variation of opinion concerning the extent to which changes
        have been introduced, and this is one of the puzzling questions that
        confronts the textual critic. Then, also, beside these changes in the
        older books, a new series of Christian Apocalypses sprang up,
        influenced no doubt by the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Apocalypse of John</span></span>. A considerable
        number of these have survived, such as the <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Apocalypse of
        Peter</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">of Paul</span></span>, <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Thomas</span></span>,
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Stephen</span></span>, <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cerinthus</span></span>
        and others, but the greater portion have been lost, and those we have
        are decidedly inferior both in style and conception to the earlier
        Jewish works of which they are a feeble imitation.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is difficult
        for us to conceive the conditions of mind and thought that gave rise
        to such a literature. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page256">[pg
        256]</span><a name="Pg256" id="Pg256" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> In
        itself it affords an interesting psychological study. The Oriental is
        a mystic by nature, and many of his ways of thinking can never be
        quite clear to the Western mind. The Jew in times past was the great
        figure of the Orient, as he has also been well named <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the most commanding figure in history”</span>; for
        whatever he may now be, the Hebrew which we find in his literature is
        enveloped in the atmosphere of the East. The Hebrew writers as a
        class are unique. Although devoid in a large measure of the
        humanistic idea of literature for its own sake, they yet subserved
        the truest aim in that they brought to the surface and made verbal
        those deeper tides of thought and feeling which move and flow in the
        universal heart, those wide-spread and enduring currents which they
        instinctively felt were shared by the men of their own generation.
        Writing only for a religious purpose, and because they had a message
        for life, the development of their thought-forms was more or less
        incidental, and was the product alike of the man, his religion, and
        his environment. So that while we especially emphasize the national
        conditions which contributed so largely to the birth of this literary
        form, we should not forget that behind all that which was temporary
        and passing lay the Semitic mind and the Mosaic cult.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The rise of
        Apocalyptic marks a transition stage in the development of Hebrew
        thought that is of momentous significance, for it led to clearer
        views of immortality, and truer conceptions of God's relation to the
        world of men, as well as to a distinct clarifying of the Messianic
        hope. Its deeper roots are found in the failure of prophecy. No
        living voice was heard among the people speaking for God as in former
        days. Prophecy had grown senile and was in decay; it had become a
        thing of the past, and in its place had followed the scholastic work
        of the scribes, mechanically interpreting the messages of old. But,
        as is pointed out by Charles, <span class="tei tei-q">“Scribism could
        not satisfy the aspirations of the nation: it represented an
        unproductive age of criticism, following a productive age of
        prophetic genius.”</span> And Apocalyptic was the spontaneous outcry
        of a heart-hunger which refused to be fed on the barren husks of
        labored interpretation served up by the scribes. It was in the true
        line of succession to prophecy, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page257">[pg 257]</span><a name="Pg257" id="Pg257" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> and though it fell far behind the prophetic
        message both in its form and content, and was even feeble in
        comparison, yet, as Charles has said, <span class="tei tei-q">“It
        attested beyond doubt the reappearance of spiritual genius in the
        field of thought and action.”</span> There is assuredly something
        that is profoundly pathetic in this deep heart-cry of the Jewish
        people which rings mournfully out of the far past; for even at this
        remote distance of time and space we cannot read without emotion
        their enduring record of sorrow and suffering, of longing and hope,
        if we share at all in the wider world of religious experience.<a id=
        "noteref_597" name="noteref_597" href="#note_597"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">597</span></span></a></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The apocalyptists
        were evidently conscious that they had no new message for their
        generation, and this conviction led to certain well-defined results.
        First of all they fell back upon the old message for most of their
        ideas; but with singular skill they contrived to present them in new
        form. The essential elements of their thought were taken from the Old
        Testament prophecies, while the material framework was drawn from
        without. They attempted in their own way to develop an esoteric
        meaning in the prophecies of the past, and for this purpose called to
        their aid the bold and striking imagery of the Eastern mind. They
        laid under contribution the luxuriant symbols of Babylon, Persia, and
        the surrounding nations; they gathered the rarest figures from the
        accumulated stores of poetry, art, and religion; and then with a
        fertile fancy they interwove these all in the fantastic fabric of
        their dreams. Then, again, they hid their own personality, and masked
        under the name of some great religious hero of the past. Enoch and
        Moses, Isaiah and Baruch, served as a thin disguise for the real
        authors who remained unknown,—for the Apocalyptic writings are all
        pseudonymous so far as known, with the apparent exception of the
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Apocalypse
        of John</span></span>, and the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Shepherd of Hermas</span></span>,—and yet we
        cannot say that there was any real motive of deception in this, if we
        take into account the views of authorship which then prevailed, for
        <span class="tei tei-q">“the ethical notion of literary property is a
        plant of modern growth”</span>.<a id="noteref_598" name="noteref_598"
        href="#note_598"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">598</span></span></a></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The fashioning of
        Apocalyptic was influenced by many different causes, but the most
        marked and significant <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page258">[pg
        258]</span><a name="Pg258" id="Pg258" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of
        them all is to be found in the existing national conditions of the
        time. By the captivity in Babylon Judah had been brought within the
        sweep of the great tide of history; the world became vaster; prophecy
        had a new and broader outlook, and its thought was forever after
        interpenetrated by an element of Apocalyptic. The strange figures of
        Babylonian imagery were absorbed by the Hebrew mind, and enshrined in
        their subsequent literature. On the other hand the nation itself was
        in decay; the power of the past had been broken and destroyed; and
        <span class="tei tei-q">“it was terror and oppression”</span>, in
        good part at least, as Stevens has well said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“that gave this new trend to their thought”</span>. They
        had drunk deeply of the bitter cup of national distress; the
        encroachment of the world-empires had envenomed the past, embittered
        the present, and overshadowed the future; the glorious promises of
        God had thus far failed of any substantial realization, and the
        contrast between promise and fulfilment was too wide to be
        overlooked. But the Hebrew with sublime courage did not lose faith in
        God because of the delay. Apocalyptic voiced his answer to the
        problems of the time, and it, like Prophecy and the Wisdom
        Literature, was rooted in certain ethical conceptions which are
        fundamental to its thought, such as that God is holy, that the world
        in which we live is a moral world, and that righteousness must
        win.<a id="noteref_599" name="noteref_599" href=
        "#note_599"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">599</span></span></a> And
        this gave to the apocalyptist his theme:—the Fortunes of the Kingdom
        of God, and how they are to be reconciled with all that God has said;
        for God must be vindicated, he is forever true, and his word cannot
        fail. This thesis was maintained in two ways. <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">First</span></span>, by
        attempting a wider view of the problem of sin and righteousness. That
        became the question no longer of a single nation, but of the whole
        race—for under the stimulus of new and wider conditions, a great
        enlargement of the Hebrew spirit took place. There must be a
        providential and moral order in the universe which if sought out will
        give the true meaning of history. The divine purpose must be
        interpreted through the broader sphere of the world's life. This
        standpoint had now become possible through the wider world-view
        produced in later Judaism by contact and intercourse with other
        nations. And thus Apocalyptic came to express <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page259">[pg 259]</span><a name="Pg259" id="Pg259"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> both a deeply wrought theodicy and a
        Semitic philosophy of history. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Second</span></span>, the apocalyptist completed
        his vindication of God by shifting the center of attention from the
        present to the future. The more certain it became that no present
        realization of his hopes was possible, the more surely he turned to a
        future age that would abundantly recompense all the pain and
        disappointment of the past. It was this that made the outlook of
        Apocalyptic essentially eschatological. Beginning with the history of
        the past veiled under the form of prophecy, the apocalyptist rushes
        on to predict the future, for there he finds the victory. The End!
        The End! is his cry,—the End that victory may come—for God is to be
        vindicated only by the consummation of all things, and history can
        only be read aright in the light of its finality. The answer of the
        End is the key that Apocalyptic offers to the mystery of all that
        <span class="tei tei-q">“which was and is and is to come”</span>; and
        it is this persistent effort to read the mind of God concerning the
        future that gives to Apocalyptic an element of peculiar interest. For
        though it is often like the voice of <span class="tei tei-q">“an
        infant crying in the night * * * * and with no language but a
        cry”</span>, it has yet a deep significance all its own; it was a
        form of thought by which God led his people into clearer views of
        truth, and to new and larger vision.<a id="noteref_600" name=
        "noteref_600" href="#note_600"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">600</span></span></a> Upon
        the other hand the shifting-point in every apocalypse from history to
        prediction can usually be made out without essential effort; for
        beneath the form of symbols and symbolic actions can ordinarily be
        discovered the chief actors and principal events of the past and
        present which correspond to history; while the things of the future
        which are predicted, reach out at once to extravagant proportions.
        Thus each Jewish apocalypse by its content and movement, serves to
        mark out its own horizon and reveal its own environment.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The general
        prevalence of the Apocalyptic form in the period in which it was used
        may be accounted for <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page260">[pg
        260]</span><a name="Pg260" id="Pg260" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        partly by its suitability to the theme which it treated, and partly
        by the prevailing conditions of national surveillance. Its visions
        and symbols and dream-movement were peculiarly adapted to meet the
        conditions of a writing which did not dare to make plain its bitter
        reproaches of the foes of Israel. Its hidden meaning, also, answered
        well to hint darkly what lay in the future; and its fantastic imagery
        appealed to the imagination.<a id="noteref_601" name="noteref_601"
        href="#note_601"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">601</span></span></a> The
        pervasive element of mystery served to invest these writings with a
        subtle charm that all the intervening lapse of centuries and even the
        present temper of a scientific age have wholly failed to dissipate.
        The effort of most modern Jewish scholars to attribute the
        Apocalyptic Literature to Essenism cannot be sustained; neither can
        we accept the gratuitous assertion of Montefiore, that <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the Apocalyptic writings lie for the most part outside
        the line of the purest Jewish development”</span>. Schürer and
        Charles reflect the opinion of the majority of Christian scholars in
        maintaining its nearer relation to Phariseeism, though admitting it
        to be <span class="tei tei-q">“a product of free religious thought
        following older models”</span>, and showing distinctive marks of
        Phariseeism in some of its parts and of Sadduceeism in others. At the
        same time most authorities are willing to grant the probability of
        Wellhausen's suggestion, that <span class="tei tei-q">“the secret
        literature of the Essenes was perhaps in no small degree made use of
        in the Pseudepigrapha, and has through them been indirectly handed
        down to us”</span>.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The value of
        Apocalyptic is increasingly recognized as a storehouse of Jewish and
        Jewish-Christian thought in the age preceding and in the early part
        of the Christian era. It forms the necessary connecting link between
        the Old Testament and the New, and is especially rich in messianic
        and eschatological conceptions. It is the chief source of information
        through which we can trace the changes that occurred in Jewish
        belief, and the later development of Jewish thought, in the period
        immediately preceding the time of Christ. It carries us back, in
        effect, to the thought-world of the first century, and enables us, as
        Schürer aptly says, <span class="tei tei-q">“to reconstruct the
        thought, the aspiration, and the hopes of pious Jews <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page261">[pg 261]</span><a name="Pg261" id="Pg261"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> in the generation that first heard the
        gospel, and even of the Apostles themselves; for however Christ's
        thought transcended the thought of his time, that of the Apostles did
        not, except so far as the Holy Spirit illumined them for special
        ends.”</span> And, as Charles remarks, <span class="tei tei-q">“If
        the Apocalypses were edited later they only reflect more fully the
        thought of that age, and they exhibit what is subsumed throughout in
        Christ's teachings.”</span> We can see in these writings not only a
        transition stage in Judaism preparatory to the gospel, but how this
        modified Jewish thought fits in with the gospel teaching. They show,
        for example, how the Old Testament idea of the future life grew in
        depth and compass in those centuries which precede the Christian era;
        and how this advance was retained and enlarged, modified and exalted,
        by Christ himself and by the Apostles; and how, also, the expansive
        growth of the messianic hope, which was sometimes almost wholly
        submerged, but which always contrived to reappear with increasing
        clearness, contributed to that popular expectancy, though in some
        degree also to that general misapprehension, of the Messiah's mission
        which the New Testament everywhere reveals. And they enable us to
        appreciate how the divine method of gradual advance in spiritual
        knowledge was operating during those prevening centuries which have
        so often been regarded as barren and fruitless; and how this advance
        contributed its due proportion to the marvellous results attained in
        the life of our blessed Lord and in the period of the apostolic
        church. The force of this conclusion is, of course, partially
        annulled if we assume, as has been done by some, that many of the
        clearer messianic references in the Apocalyptic writings are
        Christian interpolations. But the present tendency of critics is
        toward a less destructive view than formerly prevailed. Charles, for
        example, maintains that the possibilities of Jewish thought should be
        given full scope, and nothing attributed to Christian interpolation,
        or to Persian or other external origin, except that which cannot be
        reasonably accounted for from Jewish sources. The general
        independence of Israel's religious development has certainly come out
        more clearly from the investigation. As has been pointed out by
        Fairweather, <span class="tei tei-q">“With the exception of certain
        modes of thought and expression, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page262">[pg 262]</span><a name="Pg262" id="Pg262" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> including the visionary style so much employed
        by Ezekiel, the patriotic Jew apparently brought back with him from
        Babylon no new literary possession.... Many scholars explain the
        eschatological development of the Apocryphal period on the theory of
        the contact of Judaism with foreign systems of thought.... But, as
        Nicolas has said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Ideas do not pass ready
        made and complete from one nation to another like the fruits of
        industry which are transported in caravans.’</span>... There may be,
        however, stimulus without transference, and this appears to be what
        really happened in the case before us.”</span><a id="noteref_602"
        name="noteref_602" href="#note_602"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Apocalyptic
        Literature undoubtedly served a splendid purpose, for its effects
        were both wide-spread and in many respects beneficial. It served to
        rebuke sin, to maintain righteousness without any present prospect of
        reward, to keep alive the rich hopes of the future, to comfort God's
        children in the midst of distress, and to cultivate a patriotic
        spirit that cherished the nobler ideals of the past; while at the
        same time it formed a secure depository for those new concepts of
        truth that sprang up during the long era of preparation for the
        Messiah, and it thereby contributed a rich quota of thought and
        phrase to that greater future which was then drawing near to its
        birth. <span class="tei tei-q">“In general Apocalyptic furnishes the
        atmosphere of the New Testament. Its form, its language, and its
        material are extensively used.... The simplest way to describe the
        relation is to say that Jesus and the writers of the New Testament
        found the forms of thought made use of in Apocalyptic Literature
        convenient vehicles, and have cast the gospel of God's redemptive
        love into these as into moulds. The Messianism of the apocalyptists
        has thus become unfolded into the Christology of the New
        Testament.”</span><a id="noteref_603" name="noteref_603" href=
        "#note_603"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">603</span></span></a> But
        upon the other hand Apocalyptic reveals a type of thought that can
        scarcely be regarded as healthful. It had no deep or abiding sympathy
        with the great overshadowing world-sorrow which it measurably
        apprehended, and it proposed no present remedy for the unhappy
        fortunes of Judaism. It dealt too largely with the future hopes of
        the nation, and did not like prophecy address itself to the immediate
        possibilities of the present; <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page263">[pg 263]</span><a name="Pg263" id="Pg263" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> and it thereby robbed life of one of its chief
        incentives to action, viz. the hope of present success. For it gave
        up hope of the world as it was, and thereby produced a world-despair
        that could not be counteracted by the prospective world-joy which
        glowed in the messianic promise. According to Apocalyptic
        perspective, <span class="tei tei-q">“the present served mainly as a
        back-ground of shadow for developing the richer light of the coming
        age;”</span> and, <span class="tei tei-q">“the proper design of the
        world was to be found in its ending and not in its longer
        continuance.”</span> Even with the wider world-view which the
        apocalyptists possessed, history lost its value; for they at least
        partially misread the providential order of the world. As Stevens has
        forcibly said, they <span class="tei tei-q">“viewed the method of God
        as ictic and sudden, and not detailed and patient”</span>,—the very
        opposite of the divine method in history. And such an interpretation
        of life produced its inevitable results in dreams of an hallucinary
        but impossible future. It developed and cultured a form of mysticism
        that has left a permanent impression upon the Christian church—a
        mysticism that takes refuge from present evils, and from worse that
        are deemed impending, in the hope of an ultimate and protracted
        future of blessing wrought by cataclysmic revolutions, and leading up
        to a new manifestation of the divine Person upon earth, and to new
        conditions of life in the world of nature.<a id="noteref_604" name=
        "noteref_604" href="#note_604"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">604</span></span></a> For it
        is in Apocalyptic rather than in Scripture that we find the source of
        that pessimistic view which has prevailed in various circles of the
        church in all ages, that looks for the world to grow continually
        worse as the centuries go on, until by a great climax of the future a
        new order of things shall be introduced that is essentially different
        in its divine manifestations and in its spiritual ordering from all
        the past. But notwithstanding the many defects of this class of
        writings, and their manifest extravagancies, they were yet divinely
        used, and evidently filled an exceptionally large place in the
        far-reaching providential plan of God for the education of the Jewish
        nation, and through them of the world, just as God is ever using
        human and imperfect means for wise and beneficent
        ends.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page264">[pg
        264]</span><a name="Pg264" id="Pg264" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The importance of
        some knowledge of Apocalyptic to the student of John's Revelation
        cannot well be overestimated, for it is only in the light of
        Apocalyptic Literature that it can be rightly interpreted. It
        reproduces the author's native horizon, and reveals the sources of
        his mode of thought; it provides the key to the method of vision and
        symbol and dream-movement; and it makes clear the inevitable
        limitations as well as the recognized possibilities of this unique
        style when it becomes the vehicle of a true instead of an assumed
        revelation. For although the source of much of the imagery of the
        Apocalypse is to be found in the Old Testament, yet it is often
        materially changed by passing through the medium of later Jewish
        thought as reflected in the Pseudepigrapha; and although New
        Testament ideas everywhere prevail in, through, and above, those of
        the Old, yet the whole spirit and movement of the Apocalypse is
        moulded by certain underlying pre-Christian conceptions that belong
        to Jewish Apocalyptic. We find, for example, that the divine method
        in history is uniformly viewed as in the Apocalyptic Literature, and
        contrary to general experience, as chiefly one of crisis and
        catastrophe rather than of gradual development—the sudden and
        striking hiding from view the continued and ordinary. And we cannot
        but inquire how far this conception is with John the result of
        literary form and spiritual mood, rather than intended to set forth
        the intimate nature of the divine method; and how far it is designed
        to portray vividly the effects to be accomplished, rather than to
        signify the manner of their accomplishment. We find, too, that John,
        in common with the apocalyptists, dwells more upon the future hopes
        of the kingdom than upon its present possibilities, keeping his eye
        ever fixed above the conflict upon the far future of promise. And we
        cannot but inquire how far this aspect of his world-view was divinely
        designed as a message of comfort to a people in distress, rather than
        as a comprehensive presentation of the progressive world-plan of the
        ages; and how far it is given only as one point of view, rather than
        as designed to express the fulness of the divine purpose. To these
        inquiries there can properly be but one answer, the view-point is
        characteristic of and peculiar to Apocalyptic. It does not present
        the normal aspect of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page265">[pg
        265]</span><a name="Pg265" id="Pg265" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        life; it is the product of adverse conditions and breathes the spirit
        of pain; its vision is forever saddened by the overwhelming
        world-sorrow that darkens the horizon of thought. And while all
        Hebrew literature is essentially grave, and devoid of the element of
        humor, yet Apocalyptic is abidingly overshadowed by a weight of
        world-woe from which men seek to escape into another sphere and into
        new and better conditions of life.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The larger study
        of Apocalyptic Literature must continue to have its effect upon the
        interpretation of the Apocalypse which is indisputably its greatest
        masterpiece. For by attentive consideration of the peculiarities of
        this form of composition we are gradually led to perceive that only
        in so far as we invest ourselves with the atmosphere which produced
        so strange a coloring of thought, can we hope to interpret aright
        that peculiar view of the world, growing out of the conditions of
        Jewish depression, which regards it as the arena of an all-pervasive
        conflict, and involved in prevailing sin and suffering, in order that
        through these seemingly adverse experiences it may by sovereign
        control be divinely made ready for the future glory of the Messiah's
        kingdom. And we are thus amply assured that a correct apprehension of
        the form and fashion of Apocalyptic thought will undoubtedly guide us
        in all that pertains to the material framework of the Apocalypse,
        though certainly we should not forget that we must always go to the
        Old Testament and to the New when we would reach its inner heart. The
        present general consensus of opinion among modern scholars,
        therefore, seems to be, that having measurably exhausted inquiry
        concerning the Old Testament references, whatever progress we are to
        make in the immediate future in unfolding the thought of the
        Revelation must be through a further study of the thought-forms of
        the century that gave it birth, which so richly abound in the
        Apocalyptic writings, but which so long escaped the scholarly and
        attentive consideration of Christian thought.</p>

          Apocalypse indicates that it was written after Nero's fall, and the
          destruction of Jerusalem; and that the references to persecution
          imply a regular judicial procedure on account of refusal to worship
          the emperor's image, a feature quite different from the Neronian
          period in which the executions on the ground of alleged
          incendiarism &amp;c., do not formally belong to the class of
          religious processes at all. He would not, however, date it so late
          as Domitian, preferring a date somewhere between A. D. 69 and 79,
          toward the end of the reign of Vespasian. Bartlett puts the
          probable date about A. D. 75-80 (see his <span class=

          <dd class="tei tei-notetext">This identification is suggested by
          the present author as a probable one, for jade is the most notable
          white stone that was in use in ancient times, and it is still
          highly prized for seals, charms, and kindred purposes in China and
          the Far East. Dr. Schlieman found implements made from the coarser
          kinds of it in the immediate region of Pergamus among the relics of
          the oldest of the cities in the excavations at Hissarlik, the mound
          of ancient Ilium, near Troas; and a jade celt engraved with Gnostic

          should receive our careful attention, though it only occurs twice
          in the Apocalypse (ch. 6:14; 16:14). As Davidson interprets it,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“The day of the Lord is an eschatological
          idea; the phrase therefore cannot be rendered <span class=

          <span class="tei tei-q">“the day of the Lord”</span> seems to have

          striking crisis in the history of the world, each day of the Lord
          being, however, a type of the final and great day. (See Rawlinson,

          as most interpreters; cf. Thayer's <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Gr. Lex. of New
          Test.</span></span>, for the secondary use of the term. It is
          evident that the phrase <span class="tei tei-q">“These are they
          that were not defiled with women”</span>—or <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“among women”</span>—may properly be interpreted as
          applying to men who were not so defiled, though it here apparently
          represents a class, whether men or women, who are declared to be
          free from impurity, a phrase that in such a book as the Apocalypse
          is more likely to refer to that which is spiritual than to that
          which is physical. Alford, however, (<span class=

              Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread
              public support and donations to carry out its mission of
              increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that
              can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible
              by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment.
              Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important
              to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
              Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
              charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the
              United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it
              takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to
              meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit
              donations in locations where we have not received written
              confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the
              status of compliance for any particular state visit <a href=

              cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
              have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no
              prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors
              in such states who approach us with offers to donate.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
              International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot
              make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations
              received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp
